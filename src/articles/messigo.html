<h1>Messigo</h1>

<p>
    Vopel tells us that “In the times of our ancestors, Messigo was known by the
    term ‘Mansi’” (<em>Temporibus auo/rum mansi vo/cabulo innotuit</em>). He
    derived this idea from the Belgian cartographer Franciscus Monachus, whose
    <em>De orbis situ ac descriptione</em> (Antwerp, 1527), claimed that Mangi, or
    southern China, and Mexico were the same place, and that Mexico was Mangi’s
    modern name (link to Mangi entry). Indeed, on Vopel’s map, Mexico is in the
    Kingdom of Cathay, and in the province of Mangi.
</p>
<p>
    As Vopel’s tell us in his cartouche concerning Themixitan or Tenochtitlan
    (link to cartouche on Themixitan), Mexico was the furthest extent of Polo’s
    Asia; Polo had gone to Mexico, and Ferdinand Cortés had effectively reached
    China when he conquered Tenochtitlan. The Aztec ceremonies, customs, and
    wealth that Cortés described in his letters suggested an implicit similarity
    for European audiences between Cortés at the court of Montezuma and Polo at
    the court of the Great Khan. For early modern observers, the sparkling cities
    of Mexico surely resembled the Asian cities visited by Polo, implying that the
    opposite could also be true, an idea that Vopel’s cartouches and toponyms
    support.

<p>
    The narratives of a variety of explorers and conquistadors who traveled north
    from Mexico during the course of the sixteenth century further corroborated
    these ideas, revealing that up to 1600 and beyond, many believed that lands to
    the North of Mexico might be directly connected to China, India, or both. For
    example, when the Franciscan explorer Franciscan Marcos de Niza returned to
    Mexico City after his journey into the American southwest in 1539, a great
    variety of people who heard his account reported his sighting of elephants,
    camels, and people wearing silk in what is today New Mexico. In a later
    expedition in 1604, the conquistador Juan de Oñate searched for the Golden
    Fleece near the Gulf of California.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a>
    These and a variety of other accounts all contributed to “the popular
    conviction of the day that North America was an extension of the Orient.”<a

    The relationship between Mexico and China was, for many, at the heart of an
    Amerasian understanding of the world. In his
    <em>Opusculum Geographicum</em> (1533), the German cosmographer and
    cartographer Johann Schöner, for instance, similarly described Polo traveling
    in Mexico.
</p>

<blockquote>
    There is a land called Mexico and Temistitan in Upper India, which in former
    times was called Quinsay…Before our time, this continental portion of upper
    Asia [Mexico] beyond [the area described by] Ptolemy was explored by Marco
    Polo of Venice…. The land which is called Mexico or Temistitan, in India
    Superior, which before was called Quinsay, that is, “city of heaven” in their
    language.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The twelfth edition of the Dominican missionary and chronicler Fra Gregorio
    García’s
    <em>Origen de los indios del Nuevo Mundo e Indias Occidentales</em> (Madrid,
    1729), continued to argue that Polo and other medieval travelers in China had
    reached to Mexico before Cortés, revealing a continuous chain of thought about
    the connectedness of Mexico and China that persisted more than two hundred
    years after the Columbian voyages.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> In
    a material expression of this relationship, the Mixtec Cospi Codex, now in
    Bologna, which was considered a book from China as late as 1667 (link to
    Hieroglyphics essay).
</p>
<p>
    In a parallel Amerasian association, a great variety of early modern European
    historians, antiquarians, and orientalist scholars believed the Mexicans to
    have been descended from the ancient Hebrews. The Domican friar Diego Durán,
    for instance, argued in the first chapter of his ethnohistory of the Aztecs,
    <em>The History of the Indies of New Spain</em>(1581, though unpublished until
    the nineteenth century), that Aztec ceremonies, rites, superstitions, and
    idolatrous practices were like those of the Hebrews.<a
        href="#_edn5"
        name="_ednref5"
>[5]</a
>
    Based on all their cultural similarities, Durán determined that indigenous
    Americans were descended from the Ten Tribes of Israel and that Mexicans were
    of Jewish origin, generating an Amerasian vision of Mexico as originally
    populated by Oriental peoples. Based on a variety of cultural and linguistic
    similarities, many European observers debated if and how the populations of
    Mexico could have had descended from Adam via the sons of Noah, well into the
    nineteenth century.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a>
</p>
<p>
    By 1600, as a result of the Manila galleon trade, Mexico would be flooded with
    a great variety of Asian goods that was to imbue Mexican life and artisanry
    with Asian techniques and forms. Though the Vopel map was designed several
    centuries before the start of this trading network, Vopel does indicate the
    islands of the Philippines on the far left side of his map (link to Subuth
    entry), indicating the site from which trans-Pacific trade and commerce would
    effectively Orientalize Mexico by the turn of the seventeenth century.
