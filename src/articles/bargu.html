<h1>Bargu</h1>

<p>
    Beneath the toponym <em>Bargu</em>, Vopel tells us “The inhabitants are called
    the <em>Meditae</em>, and they are subject to the Great Khan, whom Hernán
    Cortés calls Lord Montezuma” (<em
>Campestr[es] Incolae vocantur/ Meditae parentque magno Cham,/ quem
    Ferdinandus Cortesius Dominum Muteezuma/ appellat.</em
>) According to Polo, Bargu was a province in the plains of northern China;
    “the inhabitants, who are called Mekrit, are a savage race.” Here, as in other
    parts of his map, and in particular in his cartouches (link to cartouche:
    Temixtitan), Vopel conflates Kublai Khan and Montezuma, arguing that they were
    one and the same person.
