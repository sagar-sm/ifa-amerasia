<h1>Archipelagus</h1>

<p>
    To the west of his Amerasian continent, Vopel shows a South Sea (<em
>Mare de Sur</em
>) teeming with islands. When Vasco Nuñez de Balboa reached Darien – the
    region located between the current day Panama and Columbia – he heard stories
    from the natives about the rich kingdom to the South of the Isthmus “bordering
    upon a limitless sea.” Since it was believed in the sixteenth-century that the
    Isthmus – current day southern Central America – runs from east to west,
    Balboa might have assumed that he had got a step closer to the East and the
    <em>multitudo insularum</em>, the many islands in the sea east of Asia, of
    which Marco Polo had counted 12,700.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a>
    Balboa called this sea “the South Sea” and proclaimed it as Spanish territory.
    Later when he came back to Spain, this Sea was bestowed with a fixed name of
    the <em>Tierra Nueva a la parte del mar del Sur</em> – in short, “the South
    Sea” – in 1514. The historian Dora Polk intertwines this moment of Balboa’s
    discovery of the South Sea with the Castilians’ rivalry ambition with the
    Portuguese; according to her, “Balboa thought he was gazing [at] the Oceanus
    Meridies or Meridionales,” which was sailed by the Portuguese on their way to
    the South Indies Sea; the ocean that was covered with islands “full of the
    riche spice and jewel-laden islands of the east described by medieval
    travelers.”<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> In this regard, the
    historian Ricardo Padrón writes that Balboa’s discovery was nothing
    “previously unknown, an unimagined ocean,” but pointed “the easternmost shores
    of something already known.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a>

    Ideas about islands, and the islands of southeast Asia in particular, were
    crucial to the formation and development of Amerasian mentalities. In his
    <em>Geography</em>, Ptolemy established many aspects of Southeast Asian
    geography and culture that would shape Western thought for many generations.
    For Ptolemy, this part of the world was abundant in gold and spices, famously
    inhabited by lions, tigers, elephants, parrots, men with tails, and cannibals
    that Ptolemy called <em>manioli</em>, and above all, was a vast region of
    islands.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> Medieval writers ran with
    this idea; Mandeville counted over 5,000 islands in this part of the world,
    and Polo estimated there were 13,000 islands in the Sea of India and over
    7,000 in the sea surrounding Japan.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a> On
    the Behaim globe, a galaxy of islands populates the sea to the east of the
    Asian landmass. In medieval European literary culture, islands emerged as a
    site of the fantastical, mysterious, and marvelous.<a

    When Columbus voyaged to the western Atlantic, he therefore assumed a
    connected relationship between the islands of the Caribbean and the fabled
    islands of the East; he naturally imagined he had landed on islands off the
    coast of Asia. In the wake of his journey, Europeans quickly and easily
    understood Columbus’s islands not as a dramatic new discovery, but as an
    extension of an Asian geography that they had long been familiar with.
    Columbus’s islands, like the islands of Polo and Mandeville, were all Indies.
</p>
<p>
    For this reason, sixteenth-century European cartographers regularly designed
    maps peppered with scores of islands: islands that existed in a continuous
    archipelago that directly linked the Americas to Asia. The woodcut world map
    in Pietro Coppo’s <em>De summa totius orbis</em> (Venice: Augustino di
    Bindoni, 1528), for instance, shows the islands of southeast Asia flowing off
    the right edge of the map and over onto the left, connecting India, Japan and
    the proximate islands of the Caribbean. The 1515/1520 globes of Johann
    Schöner, as well as Sebastian Münster’s map of
    <em>New Islands (Nova Insulae</em>, 1550), also show the Americas as an
    archipelago of Asia. Schöner and Münster’s maps depicted the Yucatan as an
    island, and many sixteenth century maps similarly depicted an insular
    California.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a>

    At the same time, some of the most influential European publications about
    early modern exploration included “islands” in their titles, revealing quite
    clearly European thinking about the insular nature of global geography. The
    numerous Latin versions of Columbus’s letter to Santángel, for instance, were
    almost all entitled "Letter of Columbus, on the Islands of India Beyond the
    Ganges Recently Discovered;” Simon Grynaeus and Johann Huttich’s
    <em>Novus orbis</em> (Paris, 1532), which became the standard collection of
    travel literature in Protestant Northern Europe, included in its full title
    the phrase <em>New World of Regions and Islands Unknown to the Ancients</em>.
    At the same time, isolarii, or encyclopedic texts that depicted world
    geography as a series of islands also presented entirely new and more
    comprehensive ways of understanding and viewing the world.<a

    These maps and texts were products of a European world-view grounded in late
    medieval ideas that the limit of the world was signaled and surrounded by
    thousands of islands. Islands were malleable and movable, offering a useful
    means of understanding the constantly changing frontiers of early modern
    global geography.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a> This insular
    mentality helped to cast the Americas into a non-contiguous yet associated
    relationship to Asia. According to Richard Flint, in the middle of the
    sixteenth century “European cosmographers and cartographers still conceived of
    the island and land masses that Columbus had seen nearly fifty years earlier
    as eastward appendages and the periphery of Asia.”<a

    Following the conquest of Tenochtitlan, in his third letter of 1523, Cortés
    described how the discovery of a new coastline to the West had fired his
    imagination: “[A]ll those who have some learning and experience in the
    navigation of the Indies are quite certain that once the route to the Southern
    Sea has been discovered we shall find many islands rich in gold, pearls,
    precious stones and spices.”<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a> He
    instructed his mariners to look for a maritime passage connecting the
    Caribbean to the nearby Moluccas, revealing and affirming Schöner and
    Münster’s vision of the insular nature of the Americas, as well as Mexico’s
    proximity to Asia.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a> Along similar
    lines, as Ricardo Padrón has pointed out, narratives of the 1543 Villalobos
    expedition from Mexico to the Philippines do not describe this crossing as an
    arduous passage across a vast ocean, but instead as a relatively easy hopping
    across close islands.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a> In sum, this
    insular mentality resulted in the Amerasian understanding that the islands of
    the Americas were not far from the legendary islands of Southeast Asia (link
    to Moluccas entry).

<p>
    The term <em>Mare de Sur</em> was eventually replaced by the label Pacific or
    “peaceful”, so named by Magellan when he found calm waters there after
    navigating through the stormy seas around Cape Horn. Abraham Ortelius’s map
    <em>Maris pacifici</em>, included in the 1589 edition of his
    <em>Teatrum orbis terrarum</em> and often considered the first European map
    dedicated to the Pacific, shows this transition. Both names appear on his map,
    as its title tells us, “Pacific Sea, otherwise in the vulgar South Sea.”

    />
</p>

<p>
    Even as a knowledge of the vastness of the Pacific grew, especially after the
    development of the Manilla Galleon trade between the Philippines and Acapulco
    in 1565, its true shape and dimensions (and in turn, America’s geographic
    relationship to Asia) would not be fully understood until the
    eighteenth-century voyages of James Cook and Vitus Bering.<a

        name="_ednref14"

    In the meantime, the use of the term South Sea indicated an Amerasian
    understanding of the world by implying that the Americas were proximate to the
    legendary islands of Southeast Asia.
