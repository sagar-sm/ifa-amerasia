<h1>Serica</h1>

<p>
    Serica, meaning silk in Latin, indicated the silk producing region known in
    particular to the ancient Romans during the Han Dynasty, when Chinese silks
    were popular among the Roman senatorial elite, having reached Rome via the
    overland “Silk Road”. The people of Serica were called the Seres, whose name
    was also used for their region. On the far left edge of his early
    sixteenth-century sketch map (c. 1510), the Venetian geographer Alessandro
    Zorzi shows the land of Serica (and the mountains of this region,
    <em>serici montes</em>) on the left side of an extensive Amerasian continent
    that connects China to South America through the lands in Central America that
    Columbus explored during his fourth voyage, (including Belporto, Bastimentos,
    and Retrete).

    Vopel describes copious silk production in the Amerasian territory, perhaps on
    the basis of accounts of explorers who had described seeing silk in their
    expeditions into what is today the American Southwest, expeditions in the
    1530s and 1540s that were contemporaneous with the production of the Vopel map
    (link to <a href="#tangut">Tangut</a> and <a href="#qvemquinafv">Quemquinafu</a> entries).
