<h1>Conceptualizing Amerasia: Medici Worldview in Ludovico Buti’s Armory frescoes</h1>
<h2>Margo Weitzman</h2>


<p>When Francesco I de’ Medici died in 1587, the family armory was still incomplete. Francesco’s brother, Ferdinando I,
    who succeeded him as Duke of Tuscany, rushed to decorate the armory before his wedding to Christina of Lorraine. The
    room contained weapons and armor from around the world, including the New World and India, acquired by Francesco, an
    avid collector.<a href="#_weitzman_edn1"

                      title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> In 1588, Medici court artist Ludovico Buti completed frescoes on the
    armory’s ceiling depicting four international battle scenes to accompany the weapons on display, now gallery room 20
    in the Uffizi in Florence (<i>figure 1, 2</i>). The grotesque tracery design was common during this period,
    particularly for armory ceilings, but in this case bolsters the fantastic forms of New World
    discoveries.<a href="#_weitzman_edn2"
                   name="_weitzman_ednref2"
                   title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a> Although exceedingly wealthy, the Medici did not have the financial
    wherewithal to fund their own New World expeditions. Because the room displayed the Medici arms collection and was
    considered a social space, it is likely that Ferdinando, as the new Duke, intended to utilize the room to project
    his family’s wealth and power to the wedding guests and other dignitaries. Ludovico Buti served these needs by
    presenting an amalgamation of New World cultures and conquests by utilizing prints, maps, and texts circulating
    within the Medici cultural milieu. While current scholarship has demonstrated that there are clear political agendas
    addressed in the armory’s imagery which align the family with Spain and Portugal, I argue that Buti’s intermix of
    disparate cultures also reveals the Medici considered New World objects to be only loosely separate from the Asian
    continent during the late Cinquecento. By interlacing the New World with India, the armory’s imagery reveals a court
    culture in which the definition of the Americas was still in flux. As such, the fresco reflects Francesco’s desire
    to have agency in New World discoveries, while simultaneously revealing a broader resistance to modifying the
    continent’s Ptolemaic, and thus anachronistic, connection to Asia.  </p>
<p>The armory’s four battle scenes fan out from the center of the ceiling and depict conflicts between Western European
    armies and natives from America, Africa, and Asia. The scenes to the ceiling’s north and south feature imagery with
    clear cultural signifiers and some indication of geography, although it is not totally conclusive, whereas the east
    and west scenes are less straightforward. The battle located to the north (<i>figure 3</i>) depicts the Medici, as
    signified by the <i>palle</i> banner paraded on horseback, defeating the Turks in striped turbans who clamor up the
    side of a hill after dropping their crescent moon flag. The background is less clear as a nondescript maritime
    setting, which could depict the battle of Piombino, a crucial trade port developed by Ferdinando.<a href="#_weitzman_edn3"
                                                                                                        name="_weitzman_ednref3"
                                                                                                        title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a>
    Directly below the scene is a marginal rectangular gold box with tracery design containing two elephants and spiky
    palms. The opposite battle on the southern side of the ceiling (<i>figure 4</i>) could be a clash between the
    Spanish, as signified by the red and white standard,<a href="#_weitzman_edn4"
                                                           name="_weitzman_ednref4"
                                                           title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a> and New World feathered natives,
    who defend themselves with spears and shields against the far superior European guns.<a href="#_weitzman_edn5"
                                                                                            name="_weitzman_ednref5"
                                                                                            title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a>
    The background is dotted with tropical foliage and arched huts cascading along rolling hills, and another small
    rectangular box is positioned below the scene containing a native standing contrapposto with a rhinoceros. </p>
<p>The scenes on the east and west ends of the ceiling are less detailed and more difficult to identify. Lia Markey
    argues the skin color, dress, and weaponry of the natives are evidence that the two scenes are battles between Turks
    and Africans (<i>figure 5</i>), and Islamic North Africa and the Portuguese (<i>figure 6</i>).<a href="#_weitzman_edn6"
                                                                                                     name="_weitzman_ednref6"
                                                                                                     title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a>
    The Turks in the lower left corner of the African scene are identifiable based on their striped clothing and
    turbans. However, the identity of their opponents is not decidedly African. Given the figures are wearing loin
    cloths and carrying bows and swords, and the setting is mountainous and hilly, with tropical foliage containing low
    huts featured in Buti’s American battle between the Spanish, the sense of place is muddied and could also be
    identified as a New World setting. The battle between Islamic North Africa and the Portuguese is similarly
    convoluted. </p>
<p>The central <i>tondo </i>(<i>figure 7</i>) unites the four battle scenes and acts as a sharp foil to their frenetic
    energy and violence. It is idyllic, with tropical foliage and a hint of architecture in the background, devoid of
    both war and European figures. In the foreground, seven men wearing striped loin cloths and full feathered
    headdresses, carrying arrows and a parasol, parade a cloaked regal figure across the edge of the frame. The “chief”
    carries what appears to be a type of battle axe, which was likely similar to one on view in the armory. The parade
    of natives is a spectacle of mannered and classicizing poses, weapons, and display of exotica, which Peter Mason
    considers a hybrid assemblage of motifs that has moved away from ethnographic accuracy.<a href="#_weitzman_edn7"
                                                                                              name="_weitzman_ednref7"
                                                                                              title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a>
    The headdressed natives set in an architectural tropical landscape are congruent with the inexact exotica in rest of
    the scenes. Who, and where, are these natives?</p>
<p>The ambiguous geographic locations and fluidity of iconographic signifiers in all four battle scenes bring to bear
    the scholarly problem of discerning how the Medici defined America and its natives, landmasses, and objects. The
    conflated idea of “Amerasia,” a term that refers to the amalgamation of America and Asia in sixteenth-century maps,
    imagery, and texts, is a problem circulating through current scholarly arguments with no resolution. In the case of
    Buti’s armory fresco, Amerasian imagery is present in the battle between the Medici and American natives,
    particularly in the rhinoceros below, and the central <i>tondo</i> in which architectural details, flora, and native
    dress blur demarcation between New World Americas and broadly southern Asian signifiers such as bananas,<a
            href="#_weitzman_edn8"
            name="_weitzman_ednref8"
            title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a> a parasol, and the chief’s bier (a trope that will be examined later through
    circulating prints). In her seminal 2015 book <i>Imagining the Americas in Medici Florence</i>, Lia Markey argues
    that by using cultural generalizations to contextualize Medici weaponry, Buti’s ceiling is a theatrical performance
    of foreign natives whose ethnographic rendering was intended to demonstrate the weapons in use while also
    politically aligning the Medici with New World discoveries.<a href="#_weitzman_edn9"
                                                                  name="_weitzman_ednref9"
                                                                  title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a> Ultimately, Markey argues
    that Ferdinando was responding to Philip II, King of Spain, Portugal, and Sicily, who banned Amerasian imagery
    because of its blasphemous content. Ferdinando was careful not to undermine Philip’s desires because the Medici
    depended on Spain’s financial partnership.<a
            href="#_weitzman_edn10"
            name="_weitzman_ednref10"
            title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>
<p>However, with the problem of Amerasia in mind, additional connotations emerge from the frescoes’ details when
    considering contemporary costume books, texts, and maps that would have been familiar to the Medici court. Although
    the Medici likely viewed these lands as separate continents and conquests, they might also have conceptualized
    America and Asia as a region of the world where the East met the West. Thus, in utilizing ubiquitous reference
    materials present within the Medici milieu, the contemporary viewer might have understood the multifarious
    signifiers in Buti’s imagery as depicting a New World in close concert with India and Southeast Asia, as well as the
    Medici alignment to these conquests through collections and political alliances displayed prominently in the armory.
    There is little scholarship outside of Markey’s work that considers the social implications of Buti’s fresco. In
    addition to its theatricality and political implications, Buti’s iconography has an ideological demarcation that is
    worth investigating. </p>
<p>At the intersection of Asian and New World iconography are ethnographic composites of disparate New World cultures.
    The mixing of New World societies through objects and depictions of its natives, particularly Aztec and Brazilian in
    this case, should be examined at the outset, because the larger issue of cultural overlap between Asia and New World
    imagery is partly rooted in an unclear definition of the word “Indian.”<b> </b>In 1588, when Ferdinando assumed
    responsibility for completing the armory decoration, the definition of terms such as “New World” and “Indian” were
    still decidedly fluid; “New World” could refer to newly discovered lands of both the east and west. (On the range of meanings of the word India and Indians, <a
            href="#riccio-india">see the
    entry by Vittoria Riccio</a>.) Ferdinando’s
    collection inventories from c.1571 to 1588 use the terms <i>Indiana</i>, <i>alla
    Indiana</i>, and <i>dell</i><i>’</i><i>Indie </i>to
    define objects from the Americas, India, of Moorish origin, and Asia more
    generally.<a href="#_weitzman_edn11"
                 name="_weitzman_ednref11"
                 title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a> The
    word “Indian” itself is loaded and imprecise. Jessica Keating
    and Lia Markey’s research reveals that the term has often been taken for
    granted in current scholarly research, and could refer to anything that is of
    abundance, exotic, of a “foreign” style,
    or simply non-European.<a href="#_weitzman_edn12"
                              name="_weitzman_ednref12"
                              title=""><sup>[12]</sup></a> In
    order to create believable and verisimilar imagery of places and people neither
    Buti nor Francesco had ever seen firsthand, Buti borrowed from multiple sources
    that originated from both the broader continent of Europe and the New World,
    further augmenting the ambiguity of these terms.</p>
<p>Markey has already examined Bernardino de Sahagún’s c.1577 <i>Florentine Codex—</i>an important source for Buti’s
    imagery that belonged to Ferdinando. The <i>Codex</i>, a three-volume illustrated manuscript, documents the lives of
    the Aztecs during the conquest of New Spain.<a
            href="#_weitzman_edn13"
            name="_weitzman_ednref13"
            title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a> It is considered to be one of the most thorough and important documents
    describing Aztec and Mexican culture and the flora of the region.<a href="#_weitzman_edn14"
                                                                        name="_weitzman_ednref14"
                                                                        title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a> (On the Florentine
    Codex owned by Ferdinando I de Medici, <a
            href="#raitt-florentinecodex">see the entry by Louisa Raitt</a>.)
    Markey also demonstrates that Buti’s quotations range from codices to circulating Flemish, French, and German
    prints, further demonstrating his appropriation of a variety of sources for the armory ceiling
    imagery.<a href="#_weitzman_edn15"
               name="_weitzman_ednref15"
               title=""><sup>[15]</sup></a> Another possible influence on Buti’s imagery worth considering is the two
    Amerasian figures in Christopher Weiditz’s c.1530s <i>Trachtenbuch </i>(<i>figure 8</i>), an illustrated costume
    book that in itself carries further significance because of its commixture of native cultures. Although the <i>Trachtenbuch</i>
    was not widely circulated, Weiditz’s illustrations were disseminated separately as copies.<a href="#_weitzman_edn16"
                                                                                                 name="_weitzman_ednref16"
                                                                                                 title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a>
    The manuscript showcases contemporary dress belonging to varied social ranks including indigenous Aztecs. The
    natives’ loincloths and the blue and red bulky striped cape draped over the king in Buti’s center <i>tondo</i> are
    as close to Weiditz’s imagery as other scholarly comparisons to the<i> Codex</i>. Elizabeth Boone argues Weiditz’s
    images are more sartorial than accurate, as many of his drawings are glossed as Aztecs but dressed in Brazilian
    feathered skirts and headdresses—again, exoticizing the figures by converging ethnographic elements from a variety
    of sources.<a href="#_weitzman_edn17"
                  name="_weitzman_ednref17"
                  title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a> Buti’s own combination of the <i>Codex </i>and <i>Trachtenbuch </i>is
    thus a response to the larger pedagogical environment within the court driven by costume books and circulating
    prints.<a href="#_weitzman_edn18"
              name="_weitzman_ednref18"
              title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>
<p>The influence of itinerant print materials on Ludovico Buti’s imagery also extended to widely circulated continental
    allegories. Coupled with the fluidity of regional definitions applied to Medici inventory, Giovanni Stradano’s
    c.1580s “Vespucci’s Voyage of Discovery” print from the <i>Americae Retectio </i>(<i>figure 9</i>), drawing from the
    legacy of Amerigo Vespucci and his ties to the Medici, provides additional information regarding how the Medici
    sought to project themselves and their view of the New World. Created in the Medici court during the time Ferdinando
    transitioned to Duke, Stradano celebrates Vespucci, who stands tall on his ship with his family coat of arms blowing
    in the wind, with the Spanish standard below. The city of Florence is represented by Mars riding a turtle pulled by
    lions, and Minerva to the lower right, with lilies symbolizing the Virgin of Florence.<a href="#_weitzman_edn19"
                                                                                             name="_weitzman_ednref19"
                                                                                             title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a>
    To the left of the broken mast is a fantastical figure in full feather headdress carrying a club and skewered human
    arm—an image in close concert with the headdresses of Buti’s natives, and one of few prints during the late
    Cinquecento that features large peacock-like plumes. Markey argues that Stradano was responding to imagery and
    accounts of New World native cannibalism and presents this native as a proud but demonic fantasy.<a href="#_weitzman_edn20"
                                                                                                        name="_weitzman_ednref20"
                                                                                                        title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a>
    Vespucci was a crucial figure for the Medici as secretary on a diplomatic mission to France, and later Spain. He
    represented Florence in New World expeditions, which was important to the Medici’s political prowess as they were
    not active participants in these voyages. The fixation on Vespucci and his alignment with the discovery of the New
    World is still evident in the creation of images like Stradano’s, and indicates a pervasive ideological attachment
    to his conquests.<a href="#_weitzman_edn21"

                        title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>
<p>The full-plumed headdresses on Buti’s natives could be a quotation of Stradano’s allegory given their visual
    congruence, but, in turn, also a reference to Vespucci’s textual accounts of America. Vespucci embarked on four
    expeditions along the coasts of modern Brazil and Venezuela which he referred to in earlier letters as the “the
    south of Asia,” and in a second letter vaguely described a single land mass that was “not Asia.”<a href="#_weitzman_edn22"
                                                                                                       name="_weitzman_ednref22"

    In Vespucci’s correspondence to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de’ Medici and Florentine statesman Piero Soderini, he
    refers repeatedly to the natives they encountered as nude and cannibalistic, white or red in complexion, and some
    bearing round shields, spears, and bows and arrows.<a

            name="_weitzman_ednref23"
            title=""><sup>[23]</sup></a> Buti includes natives with variant complexions who carry spears and shields in
    the Spanish battle scene, and the plethora of parrots in the tracery also echoes Vespucci’s accounts of the variety
    of colorful birds he encountered.<a

                   title=""><sup>[26]</sup></a> At the suggestion of Waldseemüller, the region was christened with

            name="_weitzman_ednref27"
            title=""><sup>[27]</sup></a> Coupled with Vespucci’s accounts, Stradano’s imagery and his ties to the court
    allowed the Medici some authorship in the phenomenon of the New World. In this respect, Stradano’s imagery carries
    particular resonance in the midst of hundreds of allegorical prints circulating during the period. </p>
<p>Although Waldseemüller’s c.1507 map demonstrates that Vespucci’s descriptions marked the beginning of a shift in the
    way the Americas were depicted as cartographically separate from Asia, it is not proof that the Medici’s own
    conceptualization of the Americas changed as quickly. Rather, while Brazilian iconography prevails in Buti’s
    Amerindian imagery as demonstrated by his quotation of Weiditz, as well as visual connections to Stradano’s courtly
    work and Vespucci’s Florentine legacy, Asian references in Ludovico Buti’s imagery are equally prevalent and
    significant. One probable connection to the Asian continent in Ludovico Buti’s armory ceiling is the convincingly
    rendered rhinoceros below the battle scene between New World natives and Spanish conquistadors (<i>figure 11</i>).
    The inclusion of the rhinoceros is not perfunctory. Buti also positions two elephants below the opposite Medici
    scene; because the Turks often used elephants in battle, the iconography is fitting in this particular context.<a
            href="#_weitzman_edn28"
            name="_weitzman_ednref28"
            title=""><sup>[28]</sup></a> With a clear cultural conjunction in the elephants, one can infer that the
    rhinoceros carries a similar signification. </p>
<p>The rhinoceros also appears in Francesco I de Medici’s sixteenth-century fabricated grotto in the Garden of Castello
    at the outskirts of Florence (<i>figure 12</i>). The menagerie of 36 animals include, among others, native European
    fauna: an Indian elephant, rhinoceros, and goat, an African lion, giraffe, and camel, and a New World
    turkey—referred to as <i>gallina d’ India </i>in inventories and the larger courtly milieu in Rome and Florence, and
    often equated with the peacock (which could explain Stradano’s peacock plumes on his allegory of
    America).<a href="#_weitzman_edn29"

                title=""><sup>[29]</sup></a> This composite reflects a similar approach to both Buti’s imagery and
    Medici cataloging of precious objects. This conflation of culture is mirrored by the liberal nature of cataloging by
    terminology and categorization in Medici inventories c.1539 and 1564, which classified objects by type, such as
    weapons, costumes, animals, and masks, rather than separating them by geographic region.<a

            title=""><sup>[30]</sup></a> Further, according to Claudia Lazzaro, the Indian rhinoceros was rarely seen in
    person, but Albrecht Durer’s 1515 print (<i>figure 13</i>) made wide circulation and was most likely the model for
    the grotto.<a

            name="_weitzman_ednref31"
            title=""><sup>[31]</sup></a> It is possible that the print stood in for Buti’s rendering as well, forming a
    clear association with India. Thus, the rhinoceros in its clear connection to the grotto, and the elephants and
    their connection to the Turks, form a central line across the fresco that represents not only conquest but a New
    World that overlaps with Indian cultural signifiers.  </p>
<p>Imagery tied to India featuring New World natives was also present in circulating prints and atlases during Buti’s
    period. German painter and printmaker Hans Burgkmair’s c.1526 print series <i>People of Calicut: The Triumphal
        Procession of Emperor Maximilian I </i>(<i>figures 14, 15, 16</i>) features an interwoven group of disparate
    figures. The leader wears a turban and rides an elephant, followed by a processional of figures in New World feather
    headdresses and skirts marching with an array of animals, and carrying another leader on a bier with a
    parasol.<a href="#_weitzman_edn32"
               name="_weitzman_ednref32"
               title=""><sup>[32]</sup></a> Buti’s <i>tondo </i>is a similar parade. William Sturtevant notes that the
    <i>Calicut </i>print’s details were derived from accounts of Balthasar Springer’s c. 1505-6 travels to
    India.<a href="#_weitzman_edn33"
             name="_weitzman_ednref33"
             title=""><sup>[33]</sup></a> Peter Mason argues that Burgkmair’s <i>Calicut </i>prints contain both
    American and Indian imagery—a detail that both mimics Buti’s cross-cultural depictions in the armory and reveals
    that one cannot attribute all featherwork to American natives.<a href="#_weitzman_edn34"
                                                                     name="_weitzman_ednref34"
                                                                     title=""><sup>[34]</sup></a> In grouping these
    seemingly disparate figures together in one procession, Burgkmair inextricably links their geographic proximity.
    Burgkmair’s processional demonstrates a commixing of cultures present in all four of Buti’s battle scenes and
    central <i>tondo</i>—turbaned Turks, feathered American natives, and an assembly of Asian and Indian animals—while
    collecting them under the canopy of “Calicut.” Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg’s c. 1572 colored print of the shores
    of Calicut in the widely circulated atlas of cities <i>Civitates Orbis Terrarum </i>(<i>figures 17, 18</i>) also
    shares pictorial congruence with Buti’s <i>tondo </i>scene. <i>Zamorin of Calicut</i> depicts a sprawling coast
    filled with ships, their course of travel ambiguous, and natives parading on the sand with a parasol and their
    emperor on a bier—similar to Buti’s parade of Amerindians in their costume, weaponry, and classicized gait, as well
    as his native with the rhinoceros, who wears a comparable headdress with a tail of hair whipping in the wind. To the
    far right are two fat elephants roaming inland. That a feathered native and chief on a bier can be considered both
    from America and Calicut/India, and elephants can be Turkish or Indian demonstrates the looser visual demarcation
    regarding the New World as a geographic place still prevalent in Buti’s period and fully adopted into Medici visual
    culture.</p>
<p>That Burgkmair and Braun/Hogenberg’s depictions of Calicutians use similar iconographic tropes presented in Buti’s
    American natives could indicate confusion, a conflation of “foreign,” “exotic,” “Indian,” or “New World” things. By
    borrowing from multiple circulating prints and codices, Buti created adulterated images in the armory that likely
    seemed familiar to the viewer but lacked specificity. Evidence that the Medici were slower to let go of cultural
    consolidation and references to the Indies is also present in contemporary maps that were important cultural
    artifacts. The Guardaroba (<i>figure 19</i>) was another colossal project spearheaded by the Medici family meant to
    bring order to their collection of transcontinental objects through organizing objects by region, but was never
    fully realized. Unlike the typical <i>studiolo </i>that often combined New World objects with unknown provenance
    into the broad category of “The Indies,”<a href="#_weitzman_edn35"
                                               name="_weitzman_ednref35"
                                               title=""><sup>[35]</sup></a> fifty-three maps were painted by Egnazio
    Danti and Stefano Buonsignori on large cabinet doors that were to house hundreds of objects corresponding to each
    map’s location. Completed in 1586, the project marked a paradigm shift in mapmaking during the period. The maps were
    rooted in Ptolemaic tradition but updated to reflect discoveries and fluctuating understanding of landmasses.<a
            href="#_weitzman_edn36"
            name="_weitzman_ednref36"
            title=""><sup>[36]</sup></a> The inventory and contents of the Guardaroba cabinets are an unresolved
    problem, complicating our contemporary understanding of how the Medici viewed the world. However, much like Buti, we
    know Egnazio Danti sourced multiple prints, manuscripts, nautical charts, and travelers’ reports to accurately
    portray each region.<a
            href="#_weitzman_edn37"
            name="_weitzman_ednref37"
            title=""><sup>[37]</sup></a> For our purposes, the Guardaroba’s significance lies in the fact that it is
    extant proof the Medici understood Africa, Asia, and America as separate landmasses. But the maps are rooted in, and
    indeed surpass, the ancient Ptolemaic tradition which was tied to their humanist and erudite
    culture,<a href="#_weitzman_edn38"
               name="_weitzman_ednref38"
               title=""><sup>[38]</sup></a> and was also of crucial importance to Vespucci—evident through Vespucci’s
    reference to Ptolemaic maps in his early letters.<a href="#_weitzman_edn39"
                                                        name="_weitzman_ednref39"

<p>We also know that Danti consulted Abraham Ortelius’s c.1570 world map from the <i>Theatrum Orbis Terrarum </i>(<i>figure
    20</i>), which was widely known in the Medici court.<a href="#_weitzman_edn40"
                                                           name="_weitzman_ednref40"
                                                           title=""><sup>[40]</sup></a> It is through Ortelius that we
    can gain some purchase on one way the Medici might have conceptualized the New World: while originating from
    separate landmasses, there is an indelible intimacy between Southeast Asia, India, and the Americas. Ortelius’s
    world map has a clear demarcation of the continents; however, New Guinea is positioned in close proximity to the
    Americas, which physically situates the New World to the east, rather than the west. If the map were connected at
    either side to form a globe, the Americas would nearly touch Cathay. (On Cathay, Tangut, and Mangi on
    sixteenth-century maps, <a
            href="#wu-tangut-cathay-mangi">see the essay by Peiyue Wu</a>.)
    Within the <i>Theatrum Orbis Terrarum </i>there is also a detailed map of the Pacific (<i>figure 21</i>), the first
    of its kind. The Americas are positioned in close proximity to China, New Guinea, and Japan, leaving a Pacific Ocean
    that is smaller than how we understand it today, underscoring the probability that the Medici and their
    contemporaries did not completely divorce the Americas from the East. </p>
<p>Ortelius’s <i>Indiae Orientalis, </i>in the same atlas, (<i>figure 22</i>)<i> </i>reveals similar information to his
    map of the Pacific. India and Southeast Asia are presented as a landmass without boundaries, in close proximity to
    Japan, Papua New Guinea, and the Americas. The American continent is labelled in Latin as <i>Americae Siue
        Indiae</i><i>—</i>“America or India.” The intimacy of the Americas and the East and its textual connection to
    India mirrors Ludovico Buti’s seemingly appropriative armory ceiling, and in this respect qualifies the logic in
    commingling Indian signifiers with Brazil and Aztec in sixteenth-century pictorial representations. German
    cartographer Caspar Vopel’s c.1545 map <i>Nova Et Integra Vniversaliqve Orbis Totivs IVXTA Germanvm Neotericovm
        Traditionem Descriptio</i> (copied in Venice c.1558) also joins New Spain with Asia. The Harvard c.1558 copy by
    Vavassore is divided into 12 prints that make up a map of the world. In the top left section, <i>India
        Orientalis </i>is merged with <i>Asia Magna, Messigo, </i>and <i>Hispania. </i>In the neighboring section to the
    right, <i>Asia Orientalis </i>is just above <i>Hispania Major</i>. Further down the map in what appears to be modern
    Mexico or South America is <i>America Nova Orbis Pars </i>(<i>figures 23, 24, 25, 26</i>)<i>.</i></p>
<p>While Vopel’s map did not originate in Italy, Florence was not divorced from the culture from which it emerged; as
    demonstrated, prints from Germany, Antwerp, and across Europe played some role in developing the courtly worldview
    of an America conjoined with, or closely related to, Asia.<a href="#_weitzman_edn41"
                                                                 name="_weitzman_ednref41"
                                                                 title=""><sup>[41]</sup></a> With this in mind, it is
    likely the Medici and their artists understood the New World and its natives to be of the East and aligned more
    closely ideologically with the expansive India Orient that in the Ptolemaic tradition lies “beyond the Ganges,” or
    as Columbus described during his second voyage in 1494, Alpha-Omega, where east meets west.<a href="#_weitzman_edn42"
                                                                                                  name="_weitzman_ednref42"

    This general perception was in flux, as some maps were reformulated to reflect newly discovered landmasses, while
    goods—even people—arrived in Florence through Medici connections and gift exchange.<a href="#_weitzman_edn43"
                                                                                          name="_weitzman_ednref43"
                                                                                          title=""><sup>[43]</sup></a>
    In painting the armory ceiling to supplement the weapons on display, Ludovico Buti was responding to the New World
    context as framed by Medici court culture. </p>
<p>As Eviatar Zerubavel argues, Vespucci was one of few pundits who set the precedent for the intellectual shift of
    imagining and depicting the New World as a separate landmass from Asia.<a href="#_weitzman_edn44"
                                                                              name="_weitzman_ednref44"
                                                                              title=""><sup>[44]</sup></a> Why, then,
    did the Medici continue to reference imagery that continued to conflate the two continents, in turn depicting an
    ambiguous amalgam of cultures on the armory ceiling? Due to the ubiquitous nature of these widely known prints
    disseminated within the court, narrative and ethnographic pictorial representations were slower to follow suit. The
    Medici embraced these anachronistic tendencies by using them as references in their imagery. Even maps such as those
    contained in Ortelius’s atlas that separated the continents weren’t entirely confident that America wasn’t part of
    Asia. Further, the Medici family’s liberal practice of categorizing objects, coupled with the fluid definition of
    the word “Indian,” helped build an environment in which projection of the New World mirrored the Old, lightly
    grasping at Ptolemaic tradition. Thus, the idea of a continent of America untouched by Asia was slow to formulate
    even in Medici Florence where Vespucci carried a legacy. The armory was a commission by a powerful Ducal family in
    the midst of establishing its identity not only among dignitaries from Spain and Portugal who had a hand in New
    World exploration, but also within a shifting worldview that required revisions of its classical
    antecedent.<a href="#_weitzman_edn45"
                  name="_weitzman_ednref45"
                  title=""><sup>[45]</sup></a> The result is a representation of a New World that is not completely
    divorced from Asia, situated in a court culture that was simultaneously well aware of Vespucci’s innovative
    observations of a separate New World. Thus the fresco is an example of a hyper-local, as well as larger, continental
    identity in flux—a process of reconciliation of the anachronistic Ptolemaic ancient practice and development of an
    understanding of a brand-new, largely unknown society across the Atlantic. The Medici were working through what
    Zerubavel calls “denial”– “a way of resisting the unfamiliar by forcing it into familiar mental niches, thereby
    practically denying its novelty or unusualness.”<sup> </sup><a
            href="#_weitzman_edn46"
            name="_weitzman_ednref46"
            title=""><sup>[46]</sup></a> A dichotomy existed between Francesco’s desire to have agency in the discovery
    of the New World and its profound implications on the early modern world. In step with the loose categorization of
    Medici objects, appropriation of multifarious New World prints and texts circulating throughout Europe, and the
    atlases that situated the American landmass in the East, Ferdinando projected an image of Amerasia on the armory
    ceiling that the Medici court would have expected to see.  </p>
