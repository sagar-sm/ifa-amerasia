<h1>Magellan</h1>

<p>
    The Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan (c.1480-1521) organized a Spanish
    expedition to the islands of southeast Asia between 1519-1522 that resulted in
    the first circumnavigation of the globe, when Juan Sebastián Elcano took
    command of the ship Victoria and returned to Seville after Magellan’s death in
    the Philippines. Vopel shows Magellan astride a sea monster, confidently
    taking off from the western shores of the Amerasian continent, headed for the
    Moluccas; as Vopel tells us, he was “another Neptune of the Sea” (<em
>alter maris Neptunus</em
>).

    As the literary scholar Ricardo Padrón explains, imagining the Americas as
    part of a continuous and relatively tightly knit Asian archipelago (link to
    Archipelagus entry), Magellan and his crew only expected the voyage from the
    New World to the Spice Islands (link to Moluccas entry) to take a few weeks;
    instead, it took over three months to cross the Pacific, with no islands in
    sight. It was in Spanish imperial interests that the Americas continue to be
    closely linked to the Moluccas and its wealth. Thus, for several decades after
    Magellan’s voyage, including here on the Vopel map, Spanish sources continued
    to represent the Pacific as a relatively narrow expanse. In his recounting of
    the Magellan expedition in the first four books of his
    <em>Historia general y natural de las Indias</em> (1535), for instance, the
    Spanish historian Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés edited Pigafetta’s
    original summary of Magellan’s voyage to leave out Pigafetta’s detailed
    description of the hunger, thirst, and scurvy that plagued Magellan’s crew,
    thereby downplaying the enormous distance that Magellan crossed.<a

    In Vopel’s depiction, Magellan is shown taking off from the Amerasian coast.
    He is not crossing the Pacific; he is crossing the Mar del Sur, or the South
    China Sea. (link to ARCHIPELAGUS entry) As this combination shows, Magellan’s
    circumnavigation of the globe did not result in the conceptual separation of
    America and Asia once and for all. In his
    <em>Opusculum Geographicum ex diversorum libris ac cartis </em> (Nuremberg,
    1533), Johann Schöner argued that Magellan’s circumnavigation in fact
    confirmed that America and Asia were the same place.

<blockquote>
    After the time of Ptolemy, many regions were discovered beyond 180 degrees to
    the East by one Marco Polo of Venice and others, and in recent times these
    regions have been visited by Columbus of Genoa and Amerigo Vespucci, who,
    however, sailing thither from Spain through the Western Ocean, explored the
    coasts only and, judging this part of the world to be an island, called it
    America, the fourth part of the world. But now, through the latest voyages
    accomplished in 1519 by Magellan, admiral of the ships of the invincible
    Emperor the divine Charles etc,. to the Moluccas which others call Maluquas,
    situated in the farthest East, it has been found that this land is the
    continent of Upper India, which is part of Asia.<a

    Most scholars agree that old ideas were slow to die in the face of discoveries
    like Magellan's; occasionally, as in this example, increasing information
    actually gave new life and new shape to the Amerasian picture, since
    Magellan’s voyage proved for Schöner, one of the most reputable cosmographers
    of his day, that America was part of Asia. Amerasia persisted in the minds of
    Europeans until the end of the sixteenth century and beyond, even after a
    great variety of Europeans began to circumnavigate the globe.
