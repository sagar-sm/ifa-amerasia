<h1>Hispaniola/Zipanga</h1>
<p>
    To the east of the island of Hispaniola (an island that Vopel labels as both Hispaniola and Japan), Vopel tells us
    “Spagnolla [or] Zipangum, presently [called] Hispaniola by Peter Martyr, has the greatest supply of gold, which the
    Spanish, who occupy the gold mines, control,” (<em>Spagnolla Zipangum. a Petro Mar-/tyre modo Hispaniola, maximum
    habe[t] auri prouentum, cui Hispani/ praesunt qui auri fodinas possident.</em>) Hispaniola, in fact, proved not to
    be rich in gold at all, revealing how countless early modern European descriptions of the islands of the Caribbean
    as overflowing with gold derived largely Marco Polo, and in particular, his description of the island of Japan. Polo
    describes many wealthy regions of Asia, but among these, Japan ranks as one of the most dazzling. In Japan, he tells
    us,
<blockquote>They have gold in great abundance, because it is found there in measureless quantities. …[The ruler of the
    island] has a very large palace entirely roofed with fine gold. Just as we roof our houses or churches with lead, so
    this palace is roofed with fine gold. The value of it is almost beyond computation. Moreover all the chambers, of
    which there are many, are likewise paved with fine gold to a depth of more than two fingers’ breadth. And the halls
    and the windows and every other part of the palace are likewise adorned with gold. All in all I can tell you that
    the palace is of such incalculable richness that any attempt to estimate its value would pass the bounds of the
    marvelous.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></blockquote>
Marco Polo in fact never actually traveled to Japan and obtained his knowledge of it only through hearsay and thirdhand reports; nevertheless, he was clearly beside himself in his attempts to report its riches, and his description of this Asian island with golden-roofed palaces directly encouraged European explorers and cosmographers to look for Japan in the Caribbean. </p>

    The location of Japan on early modern maps often reveals Amerasian thinking. As the historian Lawrence Wroth put it,
    Japan was “the shuttlecock of cartographers” in the way that the placement of this island kingdom revealed a
    cartographer’s understanding of the relationship between East and West.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> It
    functioned, in effect, as a kind of cartographic lynchpin, a key to understanding a map or the globe as a whole, or
    a clue to the encoding of cartographic knowledge, especially since up until the Portuguese arrival in Japan in the
    1540s, the location of Japan relative to the coast of China was entirely derived from Polo’s description of it and
    could only be conjectured. The Johannes Ruysch map, included in the 1507 Roman edition of Ptolemy’s
    <em>Geography</em>, similarly claimed in a legend that Polo’s Cipangu was Hispaniola. Ruysch’s inscription to the
    right of this island reads “M. Polo says that 1500 miles to the east of the port of Zaiton (modern Hangzhou) there
    is a very large island named Sipagu (Japan)...but as the islands discovered by the Spaniards occupy this spot, we do
    not dare to locate it here...being of the opinion that what the Spaniards call Spagnola is really Sipagu.” </p>

    Ruysch also noted that Polo’s description of Japan matched the Spanish description of Hispaniola, “except for the
    idolatry “of its people. The Paris Gilt Globe (1528) and the Nuremberg Globe Gores (1535) both equated Japan with
    the “island” of Yucatan (link to Yucatan entry), and European maps through the second half of the sixteenth century
    continued to place Japan in a wide variety of locations, in positions close to Asia, mid-ocean, or close to America.<a
        href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a> In his map of the northern hemisphere in his 1578 atlas <em>Speculum orbis
    terrarum</em>, for instance, the Netherlandish cartographer Gerard de Jode shows Japan off the coast of California.

    By placing Japan just south and east of Florida rather than amidst the islands of the Pacific and equating it with
    Hispaniola in 1545, Vopel was somewhat of a throwback. He adopted Columbus’ understanding of lands to the west by
    making Japan an Amerasian island and asserting that the voyages of the Spaniards had identified Japan with
    Hispaniola. </p>
<p>
    Europeans also often identified Hispaniola with Ophir and Tarshish, the site of King Solomon’s wealth and gold
    mines. (link to Riccio essay on Ophir and Tharsis entry) In his First Decade, for instance, written on 13 November
    1493 not long after Columbus had returned from his first expedition, Peter Martyr reported that Columbus had claimed
    “that while he steered his ships eastward he discovered the island of Ophir.” In 1501, Martyr again referred to
    “Hispaniola, which [Columbus] claims is the Ophir about which one reads in the third book of Kings.”<a href="#_edn4"
                                                                                                           name="_ednref4">[4]</a>
    The location of Ophir was much debated during the course of the sixteenth century; in 1625, Samuel Purchas devoted a
    chapter of his travelogue <em>Purchase His Pilgrimes</em> to contesting the notion that Ophir was Hispaniola (<em>Purchase
    His Pilgrimes</em>, 1:73-74). While Purchas was in doubt, he still felt the need to put the Amerasian idea to rest,
    indicating how as late as 1625, Amerasia was not simply something to scoff at, but rather a still-prevailing
    conception that needed to have arguments mounted against it. Vopel’s placement of Japan on his map and Purchas’
    discussion of Hispaniola as Ophir both demonstrate how ideas about Amerasia didn’t simply begin with Columbus and
    diminish over time; they could go underground, resurface, re-blossom, and grow in unpredictable and unexpected new
    places.</p>
