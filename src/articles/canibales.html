<h1>Canibales</h1>

<p>
    Vopel placed the label CANIBALES on his South American continent; just to the
    south of this label, we see a man chopping up a human body, and to the
    southeast of this image, the word Antropophagi. The Greek historian Herodotus
    perhaps first described the Androphagi as a mythical race of cannibals living
    north of Scythia, and indeed, directly north of Scythia on the map is an
    inscription that speaks of “Antropophagi.” In his <i>Geography</i>, Ptolemy wrote of
    an “Island of Cannibals" somewhere in the Bay of Bengal, and these islands are
    often labeled on Ptolemy’s Eleventh Map of Asia as the <i>Insule Antropophagorum</i>.
    In his text, Ptolemy describes

    races of <em>Anthropophagi</em> living in both the Maeandrus Mountains in the
    region of India Beyond the Ganges, as well as on islands in Southeast Asia
    called the <em>Maniolae</em> which are inhabited by cannibals called
    <em>Manioli</em>.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> In the Middle Ages,

    As the historian Surekha Davies has discussed, in the Age of Encounters,
    cannibalism came to emblematize South America and in particular Brazil in the
    work of sixteenth-century European historians and cosmographers.<a

    While ethnographic and archaeological evidence does suggest the presence of
    cannibalistic activities in parts of the <i>New World</i>, the location of
