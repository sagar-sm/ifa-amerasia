<h1>Santa Maria</h1>

<p>
    While still at sea aboard the caravel Niña, just off the island of Santa Maria
    in the Azores (though he claimed to be closer to the Canaries) on his return
    voyage, on February 15, 1493, Christopher Columbus composed a letter to Luis
    de Santángel, the finance minister who had personally backed Columbus’ voyage
    after the Spanish monarchs had initially rejected Columbus’ plan to voyage to
    Asia by sailing west. Upon arriving in Lisbon, the admiral had two copies of
    his letter dispatched by courier to the Spanish court soon after his landfall
    on March 4, unleashing the first document in Europe announcing news of his
    voyage to lands possibly never before visited by a European. The letter was a
    digest of information from his log, reporting his impressions of the islands
    he had discovered to the west. Printed editions began to appear within weeks,
    in Barcelona (March/April 1493), Rome (May 1493), and soon after in Basel,
    Paris, and Antwerp, as well as a variety of other European cities within
    months of his return, spreading his news with an unprecedented efficiency and
    speed barely imaginable in the manuscript age. The impact of the letter was
    widely felt, in particular because the Spanish crown circulated it
    purposefully in order to claim its rights to these new lands and ward off
    potential competitors. Europe was blanketed with copies and translations; by
    one estimate, European presses published 3,000 copies of Columbus’ letter,
    making it a best-seller in its day.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a>

    Visions of Asia played a fundamental role in Columbus’ letter.<a

    The Admiral described the lands where he had landed as on the edge of the
    Indian Ocean in the province of Cathay (<em>la provincia de Catayo</em>) or
    the Indies (<em>las Indias</em>), and describing its inhabitants as Indians
    (<em>Indios</em>), language that would prove powerful in framing the European
    understanding of the lands Columbus had encountered. The islands were lush and
    fertile beyond belief, with seemingly endless harbors and rich in gold and
    spices, including rhubarb and cinnamon, plants native to China and Southeast
    Asia. He noted that La Navidad, the fort he ordered to be erected on
    Hispaniola, was located near gold mines well situated for the trade that would
    soon begin with the Great Khan on the Chinese mainland (<em
>como de aquella de allá del gran Can, donde havrá grand trato e ganacia</em
>). He described how local Indians told him about the existence of cannibals,
    which he calls “monsters” (<em>monstrous</em>). He connected these monsters to
    another local legend about a tribe of female warriors who according to locals
    inhabited the island of Matinino, east of Hispaniola ("first island of the
    Indies, closest to Spain," perhaps Guadeloupe), an island that he speculated
    men visited only intermittently for mating, an account that draws on Marco
    Polo’s “island of women” located in the Indian Ocean.<a

    He ends, however, on an optimistic note, having heard from locals about a
    large island nearby which "abounds in countless gold" (<em
>en esta ay oro sin cuenta</em
>).

<p>
    A woodcut accompanying the 1494 Basel edition of Columbus’ letter shows some
    natives fleeing the new landed visitors to Hispaniola. The two figures shown
    arriving along the coast in a boat are not the natives of the place, but
    traders from the larger region. One is shown wearing a turban, the other
    wearing a Phrygian cap, marking them as eastern traders. The detail corresponds
    with Columbus’ description of a trade network connecting various islands with
    what he imagined to be a mainland, an Asian mainland, not far away. The ship
    at the bottom of the woodcut is not a representation of Columbus’ ship, but
    rather of the traders visiting the coast in the dinghy. Though a highly
    abbreviated image, the woodcut clarifies that before Columbus’ arrival,
    narrated in the accompanying letter, these people were in contact with Asian
    seafarers using ships comparable to those of Columbus’ crew and equipped with
    proper rigging. In contrast, Columbus observes in the letter, the canoes of
    the locals do not have sails, though they too are impressive vessels, equipped
    with many oars, big enough to hold seventy to eighty men, and able to travel over far
    distances.

<p>
    In sum, both in terms of the ways it described these new lands, as well as in
    terms of the volume of its reproduction in print, Columbus’ letter to
    Santángel played an early and essential role in establishing the overlap
    between Asia and newly discovered lands in the western Atlantic.
