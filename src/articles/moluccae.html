<h1>Moluccae</h1>

<p>
    The Moluccas, an archipelago in what is today eastern Indonesia, were also
    known as the Spice Islands because of the nutmeg, mace, and cloves that were
    originally exclusively cultivated only on these islands. Their presence
    ignited the interests of a great variety of European colonial powers in the
    sixteenth century, who gain direct access to their riches, rather than through
    trading intermediaries. Vopel’s cartouche just to the south of the islands
    themselves discusses the Spanish arrival in the Moluccas.

    The Moluccas were at the heart of the insular mentality that informed
    Amerasian conceptions of the world (link to Archipelagus entry). A variety of
    authors and sources strove to show that the islands of the “Indies”, East and
    West, were part of the same archipelago. Various editions of Johann Boemus’s
    <em>Omnium Gentium Mores, Leges et Ritus</em> (Augsburg, 1520), for
    instance—one of the most popular sixteenth-century texts on geography and
    ethnography--placed the islands of Borneo, the Philippines, and the Moluccas
    in its fourth book on the West Indies or New World.<a

    As Ricardo Padrón among others has shown, a great variety of Spanish
    historians and cosmographers were eager to conflate the islands of the
    Caribbean and those of the Moluccas, or to assert that the distance between
    them was short, in order to support Spanish claims to the Spice Islands.<a
