<h1>Prester John and The Search for a Christian Utopia</h1>
<h2>Larimore Hampton Pivar</h2>
<p>
    In eastern Africa, just above the striped band that Caspar Vopel uses to
    designate the equator, the mapmaker depicts a stern looking figure bearing a
    mitre and a crozier: the mythical priest king, Prester John. Though here he
    sits neither in America nor the Orient, his history has much to tell us about
    Amerasia.
</p>
<p>
    Vopel here places the king in what was the antique African city-state of Axum,
    in what is today northern Ethiopia, and local coinage from archaeological digs
    here have confirmed that Christianity became accepted here in the third and
    fourth centuries. The decision to embrace Christianity in this part of the
    world &#8211; first introduced here by regional trade routes &#8211; helped to
    lay the foundation for the myth of Prester John.<a

>[1]</a

    The kingdom of Axum was vanquished by the twelfth century and the local seat
    of power moved to the new capital at Roha, now Lalibela. It is the reign of
    Lalibela that is most frequently identified with the Prester John story.
</p>
<a>
    Prester John's existence was first recorded in the literature of the twelfth
    century when Otto of Freising told in his
    <i>Chronica sice Historia de duabus civitatibus</i> (1145) of "a certain John,
    a king and priest who dwells beyond Persia and Armenia in the uttermost East
    ... It is said that he is a lineal descendant of the Magi, of whom mention
    is made in the Gospel."<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> These
    rumors fed the desire for more concrete evidence, soon to come in a (supposed)
    letter from Prester John to the Pope in Rome, from 1165. The many adaptations
    of the <i>Letter </i>advanced Prester John's legend, according to which he was
    "ruling in 'India,' a geographical expression that to Europeans in 1165 and
    later meant nothing more specific than a land lying to the east."<a
        href="#_edn3"
        name="_ednref3"
        title=""
>[3]</a
> In the Middle Ages, Europeans also began to designate Ethiopian people as
    Indians, and we can see that Vopel labels places the label "India" just to the
    west of his figure of Prester John.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""
>[4]</a
>
    Marco Polo documented Prester John's kingdom in the province of Tangut (<a
        href="#goch"
>see <a href="#goch">Goch entry</a></a
>), and John Mandeville similarly described the priest-king's wealthy and
    marvelous court in the lands in or near Persia.<a
        href="#_edn5"
        name="_ednref5"
        title=""
>[5]</a>

    For Europeans, the legend of Prester John and his kingdom perpetuatedthe
    notion that Christendom could continue to expand.<a
        href="#_edn6"
        name="_ednref6"
        title=""
>[6]</a
>
    Indeed, in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the placement of
    Prester John shifted from Asia to Ethiopia.<a
        href="#_edn7"
        name="_ednref7"
        title=""
>[7]</a

    Here, we see a geographical melding that prefigured and echoed the Amerasian
    phenomenon as medieval Europeans merged and associated India and Ethiopia in
much the same way early modern Europeans would conflate and combine America
and Asia.
</p>
<p>
    A great variety of late medieval and early modern world maps depict Prester
    John and show his migration from India to Ethiopia. The 1450-60 Catalan World
    Map (Figures 1a, 1b), <a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> for
    instance, locates Prester John in Africa, where he is depicted as a
    dark-skinned ruler sitting on a throne in a tent, surrounded by other rulers
    of the continent. While clearly not a European, he wears contemporary European
    clothing and a crown, holds a scepter, and appears very imperial.

    also places Prester John in Africa, where he is shown as a very dark-skinned
    Ethiopian Christian ruler wearing a crown and holding aloft a Crusades banner
    surmounted by a cross. His costume is more typically Eastern, with his head
    tied up in a turban that flows down his shoulders and back.

<p>
    Hartmann Schedel's <i>Nuremberg Chronicle</i> of 1493
    <a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> portrays Prester John as
    a medieval monk with costumes and furniture in Gothic style. Here, the
    priest-king is receiving the eucharist from a seated Christ. He is
    light-skinned, possibly an indication of his location, which is said to be
    India. Whether the artists were aware of it or not, they were portraying the
    Prester as they saw him in <i>their</i> minds, as European, and represented
    not so much as a monarch as a Christian.

<p>
      On the Juan de La Cosa planisphere (1500)
    (Figure 4), Prester John
    and his kingdom are situated at the top of Africa, just below the fork of the
    Nile, where he is said to have great powers over the river.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> Prester John's
    appearance here is again European and light-skinned, but wearing a short robe
    or a toga, bearing a crown, and holding a staff. He is bare-legged to the
    knees. This depiction decidedly harkens back to antiquity. He is moving in
    haste towards the East.

    the New World as its own continent and to label this land "America," by
    contrast puts Prester John's kingdom back in Asia.

<p>Figure 5</p>
<p>
    In the second half of the sixteenth
    century, the Vopel map (Figure 6, detail) depicts Prester John as a Christian
    ruler in the land of Abassia, as well as Greater India of Ethiopia, further
    confusing the location of the mythic king.<a

    Here, he is an elderly bearded man with African facial features. He holds a
    scepter, wears a crown surmounted by a cross, and is enrobed in traditional
    regal garments. It is clear that Prester John's physical features, demeanor,
    and locality are constantly shifting.

    A Spanish Portolan Chart from 1568 shows
    Prester John positioned in East Africa [detail] (Figure 7),
    <a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> even though the map
    titles Prester John as <i>Preste Iuan de las Indias</i>, once again
    signalling the conflation and merging of Ethiopia and India. He is depicted
    here as an elderly robed European Christian ruler on a throne, looking off to
    the West in a wary manner. He holds a scepter topped with a cross and wears an
    elaborate crown surmounted by a cross and makes the sign of blessing with the
    fingers of his right hand. Even the throne chair supports are surmounted by
    crosses of wood. To his right is a King of Mogadishu (Rei d' Magadallo),
    dressed in the attire of a Muslim sultan with red turban and saber, his beard
    cropped. The skin tones of both Prester John and the sultan are very similar
    &#8211; light &#8211; with the sultan having Eastern facial features compared
    to the priest's European features.

    A 1572 Spanish Portolano by Jaimes
    Olives, one of nine maps (Figure 8),
    <a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a> shows Prester John west
    of the Nile, depicted as a Pope with mitered hat and scepter, blessing the
    crowd and facing West. His is the sole image on the map with a European
    likeness; all other represented rulers are depicted as indigenous or "exotic".

    Abraham Ortelius' map of the land of
    Prester John, published in <i>Theatrum Orbis Terrarum</i> (Figure 9),
    <a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> shows that as late as
    1585 the legend of the Prester still spoke to European audiences. Here, there
    is no depiction of the ruler; however, the entire map is titled by his name,
    and his coat of arms adorns the top left. As the global historian Jon Carlson
    sums it up nicely, no matter where they placed him, any map depicting Africa
    during the 300 years after Marco Polo was not considered complete without a
    reference to Prester John.

<p>Figure 9</p>
<p>
    The varied placement and movement of
    Prester John in this great variety of texts and maps reveals a kind of
    parallel phenomemon to that of Amerasia. Historians and mapmakers mixed and
    fused Ethiopia and India in the later Middle Ages much as they would
    intermingle Asia and America. The priest-king moved around between these two
    realms much as the Great Khan did in Amerasia.
</p>
<p>
    We never actually ever see Prester John in Amerasia; however, we know that
    Columbus was purported to own a copy of the <i>Letter</i> of Prester John.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a> In 1493, shortly after
    Columbus had returned from his first voyage, the Florentine priest Giuliano
    Dati produced a cheaply printed leaflet that today survives in only a handful
    of original copies, his
    <i>La lettera dell'isole che ha trovato nuovamente il Re di Spagna</i> (1493)
    in which he refashioned Columbus's letter into <i>ottava rima</i>, to be sung
    on the streets of late fifteenth-century Florence so that everyday people
    could hear of the deeds of the Italian admiral. Dati's first song was so
    popular that he quickly composed two sequels,
    <i
    >La gran magnificentia del Prete Ianni Signore dell'India Maggiore
        dell'Etiopia</i
    >
    (1493-4), and <i>El secondo cantare dell'India</i> (1494-5), both songs about
    Oriental India, one describing the power and magnificence of the mythic Indian
    monarch Prester John (adapted from the Prester John <i>Letter</i>), and the
    other the marvels of India (Figs. 10a, 10b).
    <a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a> For Dati, and others,
    including Dati's urban audiences, the lands to which Columbus had traveled
    geographically and culturally overlapped with the mythical eastern lands of
    Prester John.
