<p>America, although Amerigo Vespucci called the land the continent of the New World, is named fortuitously for its
    discoverer, Amerigo Vespucci. However, the Spanish presently call it <i>terra firma, </i>and on account of this it
    is said, not undeservedly, to be the fourth part of the earth. He went beyond the equator, where he observed a
    people and their customs, the civilization, the fertility of the soil, the mild weather of the air, and the
    wholesomeness of the heavens. He swears that he found regions more cultivated, and these same places were more
    populated with inhabitants than nations anywhere else are, if one were to look at Asia, Europe, or Africa, and the
    rest of the world. Some of the inhabitants copulate promiscuously, with no consideration for ties of kinship, and
    others take as many wives as pleases them. Others still eat human flesh, so much so that fathers eat their sons and
    in turn children eat their parents, as chance and happenstance would have it. They say that for them, it is no
    different than eating the animals of the sea.</p>
