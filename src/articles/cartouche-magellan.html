  I do not think it would be easy for me to recount with a few words the voyage
  of the illustrious man, worthy of celebration in eternal memory, Ferdinand
  Magellan. For many years this man, the commander of the ships of Portugal, had
  traversed the shores of the entire East, and, having crossed the limits of
  Portuguese territories, he had made trade with the peoples of China, who—he
  was demonstrating and reporting—belonged to the territory of the Castilians.
  On account of these injustices inflicted upon him by the king of Portugal, he
  retreated into Castile. By far the most certain conclusion to be inferred is
  that it is to be believed that the Moluccas, filled with types of every spice,
  are contained within the limits of the Castilians. The Unconquerable Caesar
  provided a fleet of five ships, and Magellan was placed in command as the
  leader of these. Then, Magellan set sail with the five ships from Seville on
  August 10, 1519, and within a few days arrived at the Fortunate Isles “[the
  Canaries, see on map “FORTUNATae insulae,” just north of the Tropic of Cancer
  off the western coast of Africa]. From there, to the Hesperides [Cape Verde,
  see on map “Hesperidum insulae,” between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator
  off the western coast of Africa], from which they began their journey to
  America, [where] they discovered a promontory, the name for which is Santa
  Maria “[see on map “C. S. Mariae promontorio dive virginis,” south of the
  Tropic of Capricorn on the eastern coast of America]. From there, at the end
  of March of the following year, they were carried down to the port of Saint
  Julian [on map “P. Iuliani”], where they were suffering an especially bitter
  winter in May; and indeed, now in our summer, there one must suffer winter.
  From there, setting sail again on August 24, they arrived at the Province of
  the Cross on November 26 [see map, “C. Crucis”]. When that place had been
  abandoned and the narrow sea crossed, they came to the Unfortunate Isles “[see
  on map, “Insule infortunatae,” just north of the Tropic of Capricorn to the
  West of America]. Then, after four months, they came to Inuagana [on map, near
  the figure of Magellan, “Inuagana”], and from there to the Moluccas “[see
  “Moluccae insulae” just north of the Equator at the map’s extreme left edge],
  where they loaded the ships with cloves. Then, when the Spaniards had set sail
  from Tidore “[see “Mare Theodore” just north of the Equator at the map’s
  extreme left edge] through the deep Indian Ocean, giving their sails to the
  wind once they had navigated past the Cape of Good Hope, they arrived again in
  Spain on September 6, 1522, at the nearby port of Seville.
