    In his <i>Lettera rarissima</i>, written on July 7 1503, Christopher Columbus
    proclaimed to the King and Queen of Spain, "Gold is most excellent. Gold
    constitutes treasure; and he who possesses it does all he wishes to in this
    world and succeeds in helping souls into Paradise."<a

    Discussions of gold pervade the so-called <i>Lettera rarissima</i>, as well as
    the Vopel map, where we see in the region of <i>India Alta,</i> just northeast
    of the Kingdom of Bengal, the label "Aurea, Eusebius calls [this place]
    Orphira" (<i>Aurea/Eusebius Orphiram vocat</i>).
    <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> [2]</a> The relationship between
    gold and exploration will not surprise the modern reader, yet its association
    with salvation might at first appear odd. The Admiral, however, was undeniably
    inspired by a profound religious sentiment; his voyages were not only
    motivated by a desire for geographical or political expansion, but also by a
    quest to confirm the Biblical text. The <i>Lettera</i> of 1503 is a
    fundamental document in the Columbian corpus, not only as a detailed source on
    his travel, but also as a testimony of the role of sacred scripture in his
    understanding of the world. The last section of this letter, in fact, is
    dedicated to the mythical land of Ophir and the gold of King Solomon,
    illuminating the nature of a mission that fused together a quest for riches,
    exploration, and salvific benefits. While Ophir shows up on Vopel's map in its
    most eastern realms, its relevance trickles over to the Amerasian continent in
    terms of sixteenth-century perceptions of its meaning. From the annihilation
    of the great Central American empires to the emergence of myths and tales on
    golden men and cities, the European conception of the New World was inevitably
    shaped by visions of gold, which were embodied by Ophir and those who sought
    out this mythical location in the Americas.
</p>
<p>
    Famous for its wealth, Ophir was the region from which King Solomon received a
    cargo of gold, silver, sandalwood, pearls, ivory, apes and peacocks every
    three years (1 Kings 9:28 and 10:22). In the first quarter of the sixteenth
    century, European cosmographers began to identify Ophir with Hispaniola (link
    to <a href="#hispaniola-zipanga">Hispaniola entry</a>). Jewish tradition in particular often associated Ophir
    with a place in India, and it was surely this Indian location that allowed
    Ophir's placement to elide into the Americas.<a

    As we shall see, generations of cosmographers and antiquarians continued to
    try to determine Ophir's exact location, well into the early modern period,
    placing it at times in Africa, India and the Americas, and often in Peru.<a

    The Hebrew Bible associated Ophir and Tarsis (Tharsis, Tarshish) (link to
    <a href="#tharsis">Tharsis entry</a>). They are both mentioned in the Genesis as the progeny of Noah:
    Ophir, the eleventh of Ioctan's thirteen sons, descends from Shem (Gen. 10:29
    <i>et seq</i>.) and Tarsis, son of Iavan, from Iafet (Gen. 10:4; Chron.
    1:7).<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a> Ophir is also referred
    to as a Ioctanite or South-Arabian tribe. These names are found again in the
    Book of Kings (9:26 <i>et seq.</i>) and in Chronicles (8:17 <i>et seq.</i>) as
    places of incredible wealth and sources of precious metals, gems and exotic
    animals. According to the scriptures, King David donated 3,000 talents of
    Ophir gold for the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. Later, his son
    Solomon and King Hiram of Tyro sent their ships to these legendary mines;
    their fleet sailed every three years from the port of Ezion-Geber in the Red
    Sea, bringing back to Jerusalem 420 talents of gold<a
        href="#_edn6"
        name="_ednref6"
        title=""

>
    (I Kings 9:26-28), silver, ivory, apes, peacocks (I Kings 10:22), precious
    stones and a special variety of wood called <i>almug</i> (I Kings 10:12; II
    Chron. 2:8; 9:10-11). A hundred years later, King Jehoshaphat"s attempt to
    reach the golden land of Ophir resulted in failure, his ships wrecked at
    Ezion-Geber before they could even sail to sea.
</p>
<p>
    The "gold of Ophir" is generally gold of the finest quality, as we read, for
    instance, in the Book of Job: "It cannot be bought with pure gold; Nor can
    silver be weighed out in exchange for it. It cannot be bought with gold of
    Ophir; Nor with rare onyx and sapphire" (Job 28:15, 16). In 1946, a potsherd
    bearing the inscription "Ophir gold to Bet Horon, thirty shekels" was
    unearthed in Tell el-Qasileh, north of Tel Aviv, a discovery that demonstrates
    the wide-ranging association between Ophir and gold, as well as a common
    knowledge of these lands and their trades with Jerusalem.<a

    The case of Tarsis is not dissimilar. Tarsis was Jonah's destination in his
    attempted escape from divine commands (Jonah 1:3) and it was known to be a
    maritime port in the extreme regions of the earth. The idea of remoteness
    implied in Jonah's story and the association with trade are possibly the basis
    on which a new meaning for the word developed: in many Biblical passages,
    "ships of Tarsis" are vessels equipped for long-distance travels, not
    necessarily connected to the city anymore.
</p>
<p>
    Fabled lands of gold, silver and precious gems are not exclusive to the Old
    Testament; they have populated human imaginary, folklore and epic traditions,
    throughout the centuries. The first allusion to a golden land appears as early
    as the fourth century B.C., in the Indian epic poem <i>Ramayana</i>, where we
    read of the marvelous island and land of gold, respectively called
    <i>Suvarnadvipa</i> and <i>Suvarnabhumi</i>. In Chinese ancient literature, we
    find mentions of a magnificent region of gold known as <i>Jin-Lin</i>, the
    "Golden Neighbor" or "Golden Border". In the majority of cases, these
    fantastic and opulent lands were located in Sumatra, Java or Malaysia and in
    rare instances further East, probably in the area of modern Philippines. The
    Ancient Greek <i>Chryse</i> and <i>Argyve</i>, the island of gold and its
    silver pendant, were thought to be not far from India, somewhere at the mouth
    of the Ganges or beyond the river. In the first century A.D., these two
    legendary islands are mentioned in authors such as Pomponius Mela and Marinos
    of Tyro, as well as in the <i>Periplus Mari Erythraei</i>, an anonymous
    treatise describing navigation routes and trades in the Red Sea and in the
    Indian Ocean. In his <i>Naturalis Historia</i>, Pliny the Elder discusses the
    supposed location of the islands, this time situated at the mouth of the Indus
    River.
</p>
<blockquote>
    Beyond the mouth of the Indus are the islands of <i>Chryse</i> and <i>Argyre</i>, abounding
    in metals, I believe; but as to what some persons have stated, that their soil
    consists of gold and silver, I am not so willing to believe that.<a

        title=""

</blockquote>
<p>
    <i>Chryse</i> and <i>Argyve</i>&#8211;and their Indian location&#8211;are also
    part of Herodotus" <i>Historiae</i> and Josephus"
    <i>Antiquitates Judaicae</i>, where for the first time an identification
    between Ophir and <i>Chryse</i>&#8211;here called <i>Aurea</i>&#8211;is
    proposed. Finally, Ptolemy in his <i>Geography</i> locates <i>Chryse </i>and
    <i>Argyve</i> beyond the <i>Chersonesus Aurea</i> ("Golden peninsula"),
    identified with the present-day Malaysian peninsula. The Western imagination
    clearly located incredible Oriental wealth on the islands of Southeast Asia.
    (link to <a href="archipelagus">Archipelagum entry</a>)
</p>
<p>
    Such thought directly influenced Europeans' understanding of the lands
    discovered in the western Atlantic. As we saw, Ancient Greek and Roman writers
    tended to associate gold and abundance with India; whether it was in relation
    to <i>Chryse</i> or to the Golden Chersonese, the idea of distance was
    connected to that of wealth. Herodotus writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
    It seems as if the extreme regions of the earth were blessed by nature with
    the most excellent productions, just in the same way that Hellas enjoys a
    climate more excellently tempered than any other country. In India, which, as
    I observed lately, is the furthest region of the inhabited world towards the
    east, all the four-footed beasts and the birds are very much bigger than those
    found elsewhere, except only the horses, which are surpassed by the Median
    breed called the Nisaean. Gold too is produced there in vast abundance, some
    dug from the earth, some washed down by the rivers, some carried off in the
    mode which I have but now described. And further, there are trees which grow
    wild there, the fruit whereof is a wool exceeding in beauty and goodness that
    of sheep. The natives make their clothes of this tree-wool.<a

<p>
    Early Christian and Jewish authors, such as Josephus or Jerome, embraced this
    existing parallel and applied it to biblical exegesis, generating a new
    current of interpretation that was still alive in the early modern era. An
    important element in the identification India-Ophir is philology, a tool that
    also proved to be critical in the New World debate. In the Septuagint and in
    early commentators, the name of the golden city of Solomon is sometimes
    transcribed as Sophir or Souphir, terms that were immediately compared with
    the Indian city of Souppara described by Ptolemy and the Coptic name for
    India, Sophir. The profusion of gold, silver and gems in the region as well as
    the presence of animals such as apes and elephants, described in the Bible,
    provided a further level of confirmation and the mysterious <i>almug</i> wood
    was interpreted as Indian sandalwood.
</p>
<p>
    When Columbus sailed West, such notions were well ingrained in his thought,
    and he left Spain in the hopes of reaching Ophir by another route. On the
    globe created by Martin Behaim in 1492, Ophir is depicted as an island at the
    mouth of the Ganges. The globe was likely known to the Admiral, and his
    interest in Ophir is evident in his writings and annotations to authors such
    as Josephus and Pierre d'Ailly. As mentioned, before Columbus, Ophir and
    Tarsis were considered separate entities. Tarsis was generally associated with
    the ancient city of Tarsus in Asia Minor or with the Spanish port of
    Tartessus, near Cadiz; alternative theories sought for the biblical port in
    Sardinia, Britain, and Africa, but the idea of an Eastern&#8211;and by
    extension American&#8211;placement arose only after the first voyage in 1492.
    In the <i>Libro de las profecias</i>, edited in collaboration with his son
    Ferdinando and Fray Gaspar the Gorricio in 1501- 1503, Columbus develops the
    assimilation between the two lands, asserting that Tarsis is an island, just
    like Ophir and Cethim. This last toponym is found again in association with
    Ophir and Tarsis in a letter to pope Alexander VI from 1502 in which we read:
    "This island is Tarsis, Cethim, Ophir, Ophaz and Cipangu, and we named it
    Hispaniola." An undatable note in his personal copy of Pliny"s
    <i>Naturalis Historia</i> equates the two biblical cities to Hispaniola,
    Feyti, and Cipangu.
</p>
<p>
    Ideas about climate played a consistent role in these discussions. Tropical
    temperatures are associated with gold, becoming a common denominator linking
    India, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Caribbean.<a

        name="_ednref10"
        title=""

    On November 14 1492, passing by the shores of Cuba, Columbus noted in his
    journal: "According to the great heat that I am suffering, this country must
    be rich in gold."<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> In the
    <i>Lettera rarissima</i>, Columbus writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
    Josephus thinks that this gold was found in the Aurea; if it were so, I
    contend that these mines of the Aurea are identical to those of Veragua, which
    as I have said before, extends westward twenty days' journey, and they are at
    an equal distance from the Pole and the Line.<a
        href="#_edn12"
        name="_ednref12"
        title=""
>[12]</a
>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Beyond identifying the mines of Ophir with those of Veragua, Columbus also
    places them at the same latitude, affirming that "they are at an equal
    distance from the Pole and the Line." A combination of ideas about distance,
    heat, latitude and biblical exegesis all came together to produce theories of
    a New World Ophir. In Vopel's map, we find mentions of abundant gold cluster
    in the vicinity of Beragua, a deeply tropical location just north of the
    equator on the mainland west of Hispaniola. Just east of the name Beragua, an
    inscription refers to rivers carrying gold, and just to the west another
    inscription informs us that along this entire coast much gold is to be found.
    Just off the eastern coast of this isthmus, we read of happy Jamaica, rich in
    gold and gems, all pointing to golden, if not Ophirian associations with this
    part of the world.
</p>
<p>
    Later in the century, Benito Arias Montano, a learned Spanish scholar at the
    court of Philip II, further articulated the connection between Ophir and the
    Americas by proposing a theory about the true location of Ophir in his text
    <i>Phaleg</i>. According to Montano, Ophir (here, a person as well as a place)
    and his brother Iobab, sons of Ioctan, arrived in the New World to spread the
    word of JHWH. Iobab colonized Peru, and Ioctan, Brazil. Montano considered a
    variety of biblical verses regarding the building of Solomon"s Temple,
    including "and the gold was the gold of Parvaim" (2 Chronicles 3:6). Drawing
    on his philological expertise, Montano asserted that the suffix "-im", in the
    words"<i>Parvaim"</i> "<i>Paruaim"</i> ; "<i>aurum Parvaim" </i>represented a
    Hebrew dual ending. For Montano, this meant that "<i>Parvaim</i>" meant
    "double land of Peru"; in effect, 2 Chronicles 3:6 should read "And this was
    the gold of Peru and Peru."<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""
>[13]</a
>
    Montano therefore located the two cities of Ophir on the Pacific coast of
    North and South America. Montano also believed that the descendants of Noah
    were listed in the Bible in geographical order, from west to east. Ophir came
    before his brother Iobab, the last one and the easternmost of Noah's progeny.
    According to the text, Iobab settled on a mountain called Sepher, which
    Montano identifies in the Andes, east of Peru. Reminiscences of this biblical
    colonization, in the end, could be found in toponyms such as the ancient city
    of Yucatan or the Yucatan peninsula, an homage to the name of their father
    Ioctan.
</p>
<p>
    Many had critiqued Montano"s ideas, including José de Acosta and Garcilasco de
    la Vega. However, the Spanish priest and chronicler Gregorio García, continued
    to develop Montano"s theories in his
    <i>Origen de los Indios del Nuevo Mundo e Indias Occidentales</i> (Valencia,
    1607). By scrutinizing both physical and linguistic similarities between the
    <i>indios</i> and Israelites, as well as the persistence of the ancient name
    Peru in names such as Paraguay, Paria or Piura, Garcia maintained that not
    only was the idea of a biblical migration to the new continent correct, but
    that the Peruvian location for the mythical Ophir was its indisputable
    consequence. <a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a> When the
    Spanish navigator Alvaro Menda"a became the first European to land in the
    Solomon Islands in 1568, he named them as such because he believed them to be
    the location of Ophir.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a>
</p>
<p>
    While piety may have motivated Columbus to search for Ophir, the forces of
    Spanish imperialism also played a role in Europeans' desire to find this
    ancient place. In either case, any claim that the <i>indios</i> inhabiting the
    Americas were descendants of the Israelites was a double-edged sword. On one
    hand, they could have been seen as offspring of a chosen people and therefore
    worthy of salvation; on the other hand, they could have been accused of having
    renounced the faith and instead preferred the path of vice and barbarism.
    However applied, theories about the location of Ophir became tools in
    the hands of European powers. The Habsburgs could use it to sustain their
    claims on the people, lands and riches of America: if the
    <i>indios </i>descended from Noah or from one of the ten lost tribes of
    Israel, they arrived in the New World through the Iberian Peninsula,
    establishing a relation that went beyond any treatise or papal bull.<a
        href="#_edn16"
        name="_ednref16"
        title=""
>[16]</a

    Besides political and expansionistic drives, however, the case of Ophir
    represents a critical instance of the shaping of a new global vision after the
    discovery of America. The fusion of different traditions, secular and
    religious, ancient and modern, and the overlapping of different geographical
    spheres is an important reminder of the fluidity of the world in the sixteenth
    century.<br clear="all"/>

        argues that between the two destructions of the Temple, in 586 BCE and 60
        CE, the Jewish people settled in the Iberian peninsula. From there they
        traveled to the Americas, on the routes of Solomon and Hiram of Tyro, to
        reach the gold of Ophir. Once the travels of Solomon were suspended, the
        biblical mines became a mere myth and the Iberian Jews were separated from
