<h1>Tharsis</h1>

<p>
    Tharsis, or Tarshish, occurs in the Hebrew Bible as an indeterminate, distant
    place from which vast quantities of metals were imported to Israel (2
    Chronicles 9:21); like Ophir, it was a source of King Solomon's great wealth
    iron (Ezekiel 27). (link to Riccio essay on Ophir) Tarshish in the Book of
    Psalms (Psalm 71:10-11) was also equated with the Magi in the Gospel of
    Matthew (Matthew 2:1-22) in the European Middle Ages (link to Strauss essay),
    and Pierre D’Ailly’s Imago Mundi (XXIV) put Tarshish on the western border of
    Cathay. For these reasons then, as the historian Valerie Flint puts it, places
    like Ophir and Tarshish were “readily available as possible solutions to the
    problem of identifying the more important of the Indies, and as sources of
    those great riches for which Columbus continued to hope,” and indeed, Columbus
    at times identified Hispaniola as Tarshish (link to Hispaniola entry).<a
