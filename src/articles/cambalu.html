<h1>Cambalu</h1>

<p>
    Cambalu, or Khanbalik (translated by Polo to mean 'The Lord's City'), was the
    capital of the Yuan Dynasty, the Mongol Empire founded by Kublai Khan (r.
    1260-1294), located near the center of what is today modern Beijing. During
    the Mongol Empire, it was the capital city of Cathay, where the great Khan
    lived for at least part of the year in a magnificent palace that according to
    Marco Polo was the largest he had ever seen. 'Inside, the walls of the halls
    and chambers are all covered with gold and silver and decorated with pictures
    of dragons and birds and horsemen and various breeds of beasts and scenes of
    battle.' It was an emporium into which 'more precious and costly wares are
    imported'than into any other city in the world,' including treasures from
    India and all the provinces of Cathay<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a>
    Sebastian Cabot's contemporaneous world map (1544), engraved in copper and
    located in the Biblitheque Nationale in Paris, also shows the Great Khan
    prominently placed on the land bridge between America and Asia.

    As Vopel's cartouches tell us (marked by blue pins on this site), many
    sixteenth-century observers believed the Great Khan (the Mongol emperor) and
    the Aztec emperor Montezuma to be one and the same person. The Venetian
    polyglot Tommaso Garzoni understood Khanbalik to be not far from the lands of
    Labrador and connected to the rest of the Americas. He described how leaving
    Tartaria, 'you come to the land of the Mongols and Khanbalik, and passing into
    the Indies along this route, you come to the land north of the Kingdom of
    Tangut, and the Kingdom of Mangi is in the western part, the land of Labrador,
    and moving south, the land of Baccalaos, Nuremberg, Terra Francesca'Arcadia,
    Florida 'Guatemala, Nicaragua, and many other provinces.'<a

    Khanbalik's Amerasian location hints at the Asian wealth to be found through
    the exploration of the Americas. In his 1493 Letter to Sant'ngel, for
    instance, Christopher Columbus noted that La Navidad, the fort he ordered to
    be erected on Hispaniola, was well situated for the trade that would soon
    begin with the Great Khan on the Chinese mainland (<em
>como de aquella de all' del gran Can, donde havr' grand trato e ganacia</em
>)<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a> The association of Khanbalik and
    the Americas, sustained by the application of Polo's narrative to Columbus's
    voyages, made perfect sense; as the Italian literary scholar Leonardo Olschki
    put it, 'Little distinguished Marco Polo from Columbus; both opened new
    commercial pathways aimed at reaching the Great Khan, both revealed new
    peoples for potential conversion, and at the same time, new routes to
    discovering the location of Paradise.'<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a>
