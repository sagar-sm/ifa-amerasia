<h1>Cuba</h1>

    When the Italian historian at the Spanish court Peter Martyr’s described
    Columbus’ landing on Cuba in 1501, he claimed that Columbus:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Called the beginning [of the island] Alpha Omega, because he thinks that there
    lies the boundary of our orient, since the sun sets there, and of our
    occident, since it rises there. For he insists that the beginning of “India
    beyond the Ganges” is to the West [of here], and in fact comes to its ultimate
    limit [here]. Nor indeed is this utterly absurd, since the cosmographers have
    left the boundaries of the Gangean India undefined, and many are of the
    opinion that the shores of India are not far from the coasts of Spain.<a

<p>
    For Martyr, Cuba was the place where East and West met. To put it another way,
    sailing west eventually brought Columbus to the East, to a point where East
    and West came into definition by meeting in the same place. Martyr is clear
    that the Columbian voyages clarified the farthest extent of Asia, or Ptolemy’s
    India beyond the Ganges (link to <a href="#india-extra-gangem">India Extra Gangem entry</a>). As we can see
    here, from the moment Columbus returned from his first voyage, Europeans
    understood and perpetuated the idea that the lands he had explored were an
    extension of Asia.

    The Spanish humanist and translator Rodrigo de Santaella confirmed Martyr’s
    ideas in the frontispiece of his 1503 translation of Polo’s <em>Travels</em>,
    which shows “Marco Paulo” and “Micer Poggio” (referring to Poggio
    Bracciolini), authorities on the Indies, in its top register, and places port
    scenes of Cuba and Malabar, or the ports of Santo Domingo and Calicut, shown
    cheek by jowl below them, asserting the association of these two places.

    Similarly, on his 1516 <em>Carta Marina</em>, in what is today the North
    American continent, the mapmaker Martin Waldseemüller inserted a legend that
    reads “the land of Cuba, part of Asia”, illuminating his adoption of the
    Amerasian idea that Cuba led to Asia.
