<h1>Cattigora</h1>

<p>
    Vopel’s placement of the toponym Cattigara on the west coast of Peru shows
    Amerasian thinking at work. Cattigara was a received Ptolemaic name for a
    southeast Asian emporium that represented an important port along the sea
    route to China; it was the most southeasterly point in the known world for the
    ancients. The Greek geographer Marinus of Tyre (70-130 CE) described it as a
    port city supposedly reached by a 1st century Greek trader named Alexander.
    Both Alexander’s periplus and Marinus’ works have been lost, but Ptolemy cited
    them both as authorities on the geography of Southeast Asia in his
    <em>Geography</em>. He became interested in the precise location of this port,
    which received considerable attention in his text; he placed it along the
    eastern edge of the <em>Magnus Sinus</em> or what is today the Gulf of
    Thailand, on the Golden Chersonese or what is today the Malay Peninsula (in
    the very bottom right corner of his eleventh map of Asia). For Ptolemy,
    Cattigara was part of <em>Sinae</em>, or southern China, and it appears on the
    bottom right of Ptolemy’s 11th map of Asia.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"

    For all of these ancient geographers, Cattigara was of indeterminate location,
    and for this reason, was manipulated and moved into a great variety of
    locations by early modern mapmakers.

    Tracing the movement of Ptolemy’s mythical emporium of Cattigara on early
    modern maps brings to light both the presence and resilience of Amerasia.
    Having read Ptolemy, a variety of sixteenth-century Europeans, including
    Magellan, sought out the mythical entrepôt of Cattigara, and cosmographers
    began to place it in South America on the coast of Peru, as did Vopel and his
    followers as a part of this tradition. The maps of Oronce Finé, the Paris Gilt
    Globe (1528), and Münster’s <em>Novae insulae</em> (1550) all show Cattigara
    in a similar position on the coast of Peru. The Venetian cosmographer and
    mapmaker Livio Sanuto continued to locate Cattigara in Peru in 1588.<a

    The South American location of Cattigara reflects the pervasive belief that
    Southeast Asia and the New World were one and the same. Over the course of
    time, European maps moved Cattigara from its original position southeast Asia
    to Amerasia and South America. In his 1572 <em>History of the Incas</em>, the
    Spanish explorer and historian Pedro Sarimento de Gamboa placed Cattigara in
    the Pacific.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a>

        <a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">[1]</a> Modern scholars have
        argued that Cattigara either lay along the Red River delta near Hanoi or in
        Southern China. It has been identified with Funan, the ancient kingdom of
        southern Vietnam, or placed in the Mekong River delta, which flourished
        around the time that Ptolemy composed his Geography. See Thomas Suárez,
        <em>Early Mapping of Southeast Asia</em> (Hong Kong: Periplus, 1999), 90-92.
