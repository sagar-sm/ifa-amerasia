<h1>Iucatana</h1>

<p>
    In the first half of the sixteenth century, as a result of medieval depictions
    of the seemingly infinite islands of Southeast Asia (link to ARCHIPELAGUM
    entry), many Europeans understood the Yucatan, like California, to be an
    island in the Indies. In 1517, Francisco Hernández de Córdoba led an
    expedition to the Yucatan and named it the <em>Isla Rica</em> or Wealthy
    Island, and Juan de Grijalva similarly believed he had discovered a new island
    when he sailed along the Yucatan coasts in 1518.<a

    Cortés’ map of the Gulf of Mexico that accompanied his 1520 second letter to
    Charles V (oriented with the south at the top) shows that Cortés shared this
    idea; underscoring this belief, the first Latin translation of this letter
    bore the inscription <em>De rebus et insulis noviter repertis</em>. Numerous
    maps in subsequent decades depicted the Yucatan

    similarly, including the Diogo Ribeiro map (1528), the Verrazano World Map
    (1529) and Giacomo Gastaldi’s highly influential <em>Universale</em> (1546).
    The Paris Gilt Globe (1528) and the Nuremberg Globe Gores (1535) both equated
    the “island” of Yucatan with Japan (link to Hispaniola entry). The
    cosmographer Joannes Myritius Melitensis described the Yucatan as an island as
    late as 1590.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>
