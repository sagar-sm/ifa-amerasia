<h1>Zonal Hemispherical Maps</h1>

<p>
    Here and on the other side of the Habsburg imperial coat of arms we find two
    maps in hemispheric projection, each representing one half of a globe, an
    alternative projection to the unitary cordiform projection of the large
    <em>mappamundi</em> below. Both these hemispheric maps and the main map are
    clearly marked by five latitude divisions (painted in red both here and on the
    large map below) that serve to divide the world up into five climatic zones,
    or <em>climata</em>, a system of organizing the world’s regions developed by
    ancient geographers going back at least to Parmenides and most influentially
    expounded by the fifth-century CE writer Macrobius in his
    <em>Commentary on Scipio’s Dream</em>. Above the arctic and below the
    antarctic circles are two frigid zones, regions of excessive cold that cannot
    support life. Between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn on either side of
    the equator is the torrid zone, a region of raging heat that, according to
    Parmenides and then Macrobius’s many medieval readers, was also inhospitable
    to life and uninhabited. Between the torrid and frigid zones are the temperate
    zones, the inhabited and civilized parts of the world. The known inhabited
    world was in the northern temperate zone, leaving it a matter of speculation
    whether in the antipodes there were parallel civilizations as yet unknown.
    Along the left edge of the Vopel map we see each of these zones clearly
    labeled along the appropriate latitudes. Nicolás Wey Gómez showed that this
    thinking about latitude rather than longitude directly motivated Columbus’s
    observations. Columbus had set out to discover the equatorial torrid zone to
    prove, among other things, that they were temperate and habitable. The
    discovery that the tropics were in fact fertile and inhabited made possible
    descriptions of the Caribbean and its people that corresponded in many ways to
    descriptions of India, thought to occupy the same latitude.<a

    The two hemispheric maps are flanked by portraits of significant cosmographers
    of Antiquity. On either side of the Western hemisphere with the New World are
    Solinus and Strabo; on either side of the Eastern hemisphere with Europe,
    Africa, and most of Asia are Pomponius Mela and Ptolemy. In 1520 Peter Apianus
    published a world map that closely followed Waldseemüller’s 1507 map, with its
    representation of the New World and a landmass labelled America. A
    cosmographer celebrated by the Emperor Charles V, Apianus was a significant
    precursor for Vopel. As the influential Apianus 1520 map was published
    together with editions of Solinus’ <em>Polyhistor</em> (1520) and of Pomponius
    Mela’s <em>De Situ Orbis</em> (1522),<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>
    it is possible that these associations prompted the inclusion of these two
    geographers on Vopel’s map, which was intended to be a much updated and more
    elaborate world map to replace that of Apianus.

    The inclusion of the more famous Strabo and Ptolemy hardly requires
    explanation, though their placement in relation to the hemispheres is telling.
    Strabo is appropriately placed closest to the latest New World lands, a
    position appropriate for one who had argued that the geographer need only
    represent those places known to him, without needing to connect the dots into
    closed entities such as a singular world island. An open geographical system,
    he proposed, would make clearer the limits of knowledge of the world and the
    fact that knowledge of the farthest lands would develop. Strabo also rejected
    the Parmenidean idea that the torrid zone was uninhabitable, proposing that it
    was temperate, fertile, and inhabited, an alternative tradition that gained
    increasing acceptance in the later Middle Ages in the West and ultimately
    informed Columbus’ effort to test the theory.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"

    It is therefore appropriate that Strabo holds the globe at this edge, turning
    to look at the latest discoveries, while Ptolemy is placed at the other side,
    near the part of Asia that he had considered to be the limit of the inhabited
    world.
