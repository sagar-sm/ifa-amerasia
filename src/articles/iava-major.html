<h1>Iava Major</h1>

<p>
    As our discussion of Archipelagus shows (link to <a href="#archipelagus">Archipelagus entry</a>), Java, an island
    in the Indonesian archipelago, was one of the many southeast Asian islands
    that formed part of the continuum in the European imagination between Asia and
    America. It is necessary to observe that Vopel has split Java into Java major
    and minor, further, he has split these two islands so that the eastern half of
    both islands is visible on the left edge of the map, and the western half of
    both islands is visible on the right edge of the map. Though it did not
    produce any spices per se, it had been an entrepôt for the global spice trade
    for centuries before Vopel made his map. We can see its Amerasian nature in a
    variety of examples. For instance, writing to his colleague Domenico Malipiero
    in 1501, the Venetian ambassador to Lisbon, Angelo Trevisan, stated that he
    believed newly discovered island of Jamaica was Java.<a

    In the middle of the sixteenth century, the cosmographer Sebastian Münster
    visually underscored the continuity of the Asian archipelago with the islands
    of the Americas by employing the same print of cannibalism to illustrate daily
    life in both Java and the Caribbean in his Cosmographia (1550).<a

        <a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">[2]</a> We can see this is a great
        variety of editions. See for instance Sebastian Münster,
        <em>Cosmographia universale</em> (Cologne: Arnold Byrckmann, 1575), 1173 and
        1179.
