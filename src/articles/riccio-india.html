<h1>India and <i>indiano</i>: the persistence of Amerasia in the Italian language</h1>
<h2>Vittoria Riccio </h2>
<p>In tracing the history of ‘<i>India’</i> and its derivatives in the Italian language, it will immediately appear
    clear that we are dealing with a fluid and multifaceted term that overcomes the boundaries of its most immediate
    meaning. The origin of the word has a geographical nature: it derives from the Greek
    <i>Ἰ</i><i>νδία </i>(<i>India</i>)<i>, </i>which indicated the land of the Indus River (<i>Sindhu </i>in Sanskrit,
    <i>Hindu</i> in Old Persian); the people inhabiting those regions were called <i>Ἰ</i><i>νδοί </i>(<i>Indoi</i>). In
    its Latin form, <i>India</i> transmigrated into Italian vernaculars and was often used as an attribute for precious
    goods, such as minerals and pigments.<a href="#riccio_edn1"
                                            name="riccio_ednref1"
                                            title=""><sup>[1]</sup></a> The term was generally used as a toponym during
    medieval times; however, the expansion of its meaning beyond geographical borders is not a phenomenon limited to the
    16<sup>th</sup> century. Since Antiquity, in fact, India represented also an <i>other </i>place, a remote land
    inhabited by monsters and bizarre creatures in the minds of the Ancient Greeks, or the location of Terrestrial
    Paradise in the Middle Ages. These two extremes speak about a distance that is not only spatial, and that makes
    India a fantastic repository of supernatural otherness. The traditional “confusion” between India and Ethiopia
    perfectly exemplifies this tendency.<a

            name="riccio_ednref2"
            title=""><sup>[2]</sup></a>      </p>
<p>The discovery of the New World marks the beginning of a new life for ‘<i>India’; </i>the 16<sup>th</sup> century
    represents, in fact, the apex of this longstanding philological disorder. It is well known how Christopher Columbus,
    certain he had landed in Marco Polo’s Orient, became the first player in a linguistic misunderstanding that still
    persists today. A visual example can be observed in world maps and globes from the 16<sup>th</sup> century that
    concretely show the ubiquity of India; in Caspar Vopel’s World Map, for instance, we can find several <i>Indie</i>,
    disseminated around Asia, America and Africa. It is important, however, to separate the historical “error” from the
    linguistic and cultural one; the former, resolved in a few decades with Vespucci’s famed intuition, was only the
    spark that gave life to the latter. </p>
<p>The five editions of the <i>Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca</i> are the perfect tool to investigate this
    evolution. The last publication describes India as follows: </p>
<p><b>INDIA</b>. Sost. femm. <i>Dalle note regioni d’Asia e di America designate con questo nome, e feraci di prodotti
    rari e preziosi, India, e più spesso nel plur., Indie prendesi familiarmente e figuratam. a denotare Gran copia o
    Abbondanza di checchessia, o di ciò che occorre all’uopo, e talvolta anche Buona fortuna, Ricchezza, Fonte di
    ricchezza, e simili; ed usasi più che altro nelle maniere Avere l’India o le Indie, Esserci Indie o le Indie, Trovar
    le Indie. </i>[…]</p>
<p>§ II. <i>Quindi Venire dalle Indie vale Venire da luoghi remoti e di costumi diversi dai nostri ; e scherzevolmente
    applicasi a chi non sa, o fa le viste di ignorare, le usanze, o fatti notissimi, del luogo dove arriva, o dove si
    trova.</i><a href="#riccio_edn3"
             name="riccio_ednref3"
             title=""><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
<p>This definition is permeated by a sense of flexibility that speaks to us about the multivalence of the term. India is
    not only a country, it is an entity. The geographical indicators only serve to blur its physical borders; Asia and
    America play an equal role in shaping its identity. India is a synonym for Wealth and Abundance and, at the same
    time, a remote land that is unquestionably different from us. The term becomes a container for any sort of thing,
    almost a shape-shifting body that adapts, from time to time, to our needs. We will see, however, how this apparently
    universal and fixed value is, indeed, more subtle, precise and variegated.</p>
<p>The entry for ‘<i>indiano’</i> provides interesting material as well:  </p>
<p><b>INDIANO</b>. Add. <i>Propriamente vale Dell’India o Delle Indie, Appartenente alle Indie ; e detto di persona, Che
    è nativo, o originario, delle Indie ; ed usasi familiarmente nella maniera Fare l’indiano, che significa fingere di
    ignorare quello che uno sa rispetto ad atti, fatti, o persone, a pratiche, maneggi, e simili ; quasi Far le viste di
    essere dell’Indie, o di altro luogo assai lontano, e quindi non informato affatto delle cose del paese. Lo stesso
    Fare il nesci o Fare lo gnorri</i>[…].<a
        href="#riccio_edn4"
        name="riccio_ednref4"
        title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
<p>The idea of distance returns in this second definition, especially in the idiom ‘<i>fare l’indiano</i>’ or ‘to
    pretend to ignore something as if you were coming from such a remote land that you could not be informed of the
    facts of this country’. The definition of the <i>Vocabolario,</i> however, oddly overlooks the consideration of the
    Indian diffused in the 16<sup>th</sup> century. The travel literature, the letters, and the accounts of the
    explorers all agree on defining the indigenous populations of the Americas as shy, timid, and naïve

    <a href="#riccio_edn5"
       name="riccio_ednref5"
       title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a> an idea that easily translates into a negative conception of the <i>indio</i>, which
    becomes a synonym of uncultured, pagan, and savage.<a href="#riccio_edn6"
                                                          name="riccio_ednref6"
                                                          title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a> <i>‘Indiano</i>’ and <i>‘fare
        l’indiano</i>’ evoke the same idea of remoteness enclosed in the definition of <i>India</i>, but at the same
    time they imply a moral and cultural judgement. Curiously, the idiom stimulates a question that contains in itself
    the first germs of the Amerasian problem: which <i>indiano</i> are we referring to? The reference to the naïveté
    inevitably points at the Amerindians, but the ‘faraway land’ corresponds to the Indies, East or West we cannot know.
</p>
<p>One last observation on the <i>Vocabolario</i> regards chronology. The entries discussed above only appear in the
    fifth edition, published between 1843 and 1923, and they are still valid today. Therefore, we are discussing a
    relatively recent definition, and this raises a series of questions on the use of the term in the 16<sup>th</sup>
    century and the origin of the insightful description that we find in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The only obvious
    mention of India, present since the first edition of 1612, is the term ‘<i>indico’<a href="#riccio_edn7"
                                                                                         name="riccio_ednref7"
                                                                                         title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a></i>.
<p>This eloquent absence, however, is not translated into an equivalent silence: ‘<i>India’ </i>and ‘<i>indiano’ </i>populate
    the vocabulary, infiltrating the definitions of many terms, from ‘<i>gallo</i>’ to ‘<i>pepe</i>’, to ‘<i>caldo</i>’
    and ‘<i>tamarindi</i>’. The occurrence of such attributes, moreover, multiplies from one publication to the other,
    to the extreme cases of ‘<i>poleggio’ </i>and ‘<i>porcellino</i>’, in which reference to India appears only in the
    fourth edition (1729-38) and is supplemented by a rather longer definition. The use of India as an attribute is a
    clear allusion to the ideas of abundance and distance and it refers, at the same time, to the various historical
    conception related to it. The natural abundance of the Garden of Eden, for instance, or the tales of mythical reigns
    refulgent of gold and silver<a href="#riccio_edn8"
                                   name="riccio_ednref8"
                                   title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a> could have explained, in the Western mind, the profusion
    of products flooding the European markets. (On the mapping of Paradise, <a href="#chang-paradise">see the entry by
        Edward Chang</a>) It is not surprising, then, that the nomenclature <i>‘d’India’ </i>or <i>‘delle Indie</i>’ was
    applied to plants, fruits, animals and luxury goods, especially if we consider the mercantile culture of the Italian
    peninsula, whose contacts with the East were mainly commercial. After 1492, the arrival of American goods in Europe
    encountered this sort of mentality, which resulted in an extension of the nomenclature to these new products.
    Whether West or East Indies, these goods were coming from distant countries and therefore their cost was higher; in
    this sense, ‘<i>indiano</i>’ acquires a further semantic level, denoting more generally things with a non-European
    provenance, or ‘exotic’. </p>
<p>A perfect example of the various uses of ‘<i>India’</i> and ’<i>indiano’ </i>is Giorgio Vasari. The first meaning we
    encounter is the simplest one: reminiscent of medieval writers and contemporary merchants, he uses the attribute
    ‘<i>d’India’ </i>or ‘<i>indiano’</i> in reference to animals.<a href="#riccio_edn9"
                                                                    name="riccio_ednref9"
                                                                    title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a> In other cases, Vasari
    indeed refers to the continent America, therefore using <i>‘Indie’ </i>with a precise geographical intent. </p>
<p>One example of this is the description of the Guardaroba in Palazzo Vecchio, where Ignazio Danti painted <i>le tavole
    di Tolomeo misurate perfettamente tutte, e ricorrette secondo gli autori nuovi e con le carte giuste delle
    navigazioni, con somma diligenzia fatte le scale loro da misurare, et i gradi dove sono in quelle, e’ nomi antichi e
    moderni.</i><a
        href="#riccio_edn10"
        name="riccio_ednref10"
        title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a>&nbsp;The tables accurately described by Vasari depict the known world, which, he
    tells us, is divided in four equal parts: Europe, Africa, Asia and the West Indies.<a
            href="#riccio_edn11"
            name="riccio_ednref11"
            title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a> The Indies are mentioned again in relation to the portrait of Amerigo Vespucci
    <i>che fece le navigazioni delle Indie</i><a href="#riccio_edn12"
                                                 name="riccio_ednref12"
                                                 title=""><sup>[12]</sup></i></a> and one last time in the description
    of the Palazzo degli Spini, in Florence:</p>
<p><i>Ma ritornando allo spazio della facciata che svolgendo al palazzo degli Spini s'appoggiava, si vedeva di chiaro
    oscuro dipinta in esso una Ninfa tutta inculta e poco meno che ignuda, in mez[z]o a molti nuovi animali: et era
    questa presa per la nuova terra del Perù, con l'altre nuove Indie Occidentali, sotto gl'auspizii della
    fortunatissima Casa d'Austria.</i><a
            href="#riccio_edn13"
            name="riccio_ednref13"
            title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>
<p>The recognition of the existence of a fourth part of the world, equal and separated from the other continents, does
    not stop Vasari from using the word ‘<i>indiano’</i> in and ambiguous and fluid manner, sometimes as a mere
    signifier for ‘exotic’ or ‘foreign’, sometimes charged with deeper meanings. The idea of distance is present in his
    description of the <a
            href="https://www.uffizi.it/opere/adorazione-dei-magi-9f5c2075-8e8f-4883-b3ce-62fc6625a2b4#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=1">Adoration
        of the Magi</a> (1496) by Filippino Lippi. The painting, commissioned by the friars of San Donato Scopeto,
    illustrates the Augustinian tradition, specifically the <i>Homilies </i>of Saint Augustine. According to the text,
    on that day Christ was offered to the adoration of pagans, alluding to his mission as the Savior of all the people
    of the world. The crowded scene is filled with Indians, Moors and bizarre costumes<a href="#riccio_edn14"
                                                                                         name="riccio_ednref14"
                                                                                         title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a>,
    an expedient through which Lippi illustrates the <i>Homilies</i> and Vasari narrates them; turbans and camels,
    pearls and sandals in the painting have the same value that the words ‘<i>indiani</i>’ and ‘<i>Mori’ </i>have in the
    text. (For an essay on the Magi in the context of the New World discoveries, <a
            href="#strauss-magi">see the essay by Scarlett H. Strauss</a>)</p>
<p>A similar concept is at work in the <a
        href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Andrea_del_Sarto_-_Triumph_of_Caesar_-_WGA00382.jpg">Tribute
    to Caesar</a><i> </i>(1520 ca.) a fresco by Andrea Del Sarto, in the Medicean Villa of Poggio a Caiano.</p>
<p><i>In questa opera Andrea, per superare il Francia e Iacopo, si mise a fatiche non più usate, tirando in quella una
    magnifica prospettiva et un ordine di scale molto difficile, per le quali salendo si perviene alla sedia di Cesare;
    e queste adornò di statue molto ben considerate. Non gli bastando aver mostro il bell’ingegno suo nella varietà di
    quelle figure che portano addosso que’ tanti diversi animali, come sono una figura indiana che ha una casacca gialla
    indosso e sopra le spalle una gabbia, tirata in prospettiva, con alcuni papagalli dentro e fuori, che sono cosa
    rarissima; e come sono ancora alcuni che guidano capre indiane, leoni, giraffi, leonze, lupi cervieri, scimie e mori
    et altre belle fantasie accommodate con bella maniera e lavorate in fresco divinissimamente, fece anco in su quelle
    scalee a sedere un nano che tiene in una scatola il camaleonte, tanto ben fatto, che non si può immaginare nella

        name="riccio_ednref15"
        title=""><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>
<p>The most important element in this passage is the ‘<i>figura indiana</i>’. The choice of these words poses a problem:
    why is Vasari referring to this figure as ‘Indian’? The man is seen from the back, his face is not visible;
    apparently there is nothing that would explain this unusual characterization. A closer observation, however, will
    offer some details that could clarify the problem. The figure is wearing pants, traditionally associated with an
    Oriental or Barbaric fashion (especially in an Ancient Roman setting); the mention of the yellow cloak could provide
    another explanation if we read it as a reference to the pigment <i>giallo indiano</i>. All these reasons, however,
    seem feeble, especially if we consider that the scene represents Caesar receiving a tribute from foreign
    ambassadors,<a href="#riccio_edn16"
                   name="riccio_ednref16"
                   title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a> therefore justifying the presence of not one, but many, “Indians.” The
    text could help us understand: Vasari describes the figure focusing the attention on two elements: the yellow cloak
    and the cage with parrots that he is carrying. (On parrots, <a
            href="#lipsman-parrots">see the entry by Claire Lipsman</a>.) The cage is filled with numerous birds, most
    likely coming from different parts of the globe, and is crowned by a magnificent, brightly colored specimen.
    Although not depicted from life, the disposition and color of the feathers and the form of the beak seem to suggest
    an identification with the Scarlet Macaw (Ara Macao), native to the Amazon region. The inclusion of an unmistakably
    American parrot reveals that Andrea Del Sarto deliberately chose to reference the New World in this work in order to
    show that people from every corner of the Earth, even from the most remote ones, came to pay tribute to Caesar, and
    metaphorically to the Medici.<a href="#riccio_edn17"
                                    name="riccio_ednref17"
                                    title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a> The placement of the figure on the extreme left of the
    fresco, just as the Americas were “placed” on the extreme “left” of Europe, seems to confirm this hypothesis. It is
    important to note that Del Sarto’s work on painting the scene does not extend beyond the figure of Caesar; the right
    side of the fresco was completed in 1585 by Alessandro Allori. The later addition perhaps altered the balance of the
    original composition, enclosed between two very well-defined extremes: almost Columns of Hercules, the ‘<i>figura
        indiana</i>’ and Caesar serve as pillars; the New World on one side, open and unknown, and, on the other side,
    the embodiment of Rome , the classical center of the world, ideally replaced by Florence in the Renaissance. This
    symbolic system is perfectly understood by Vasari, who participates in the iconographical game by calling the figure
    ‘Indian’.  </p>
<p>Other 16<sup>th</sup> century authors, such as Ariosto and Tasso, follow a similar trend. The <i>Orlando Furioso </i>and
    the <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i> represent two more examples of the problem of awareness. In canto 15 of the <i>Orlando</i>,
    in a tribute to Charles V and his global empire, Ariosto elevates Cortés to immortal glory and, in an epic parallel,
    Tasso uses his own canto 15 to honor Columbus as one of the most illustrious men of his time. The grand encomia paid
    to the protagonists of the age of exploration prove the interest of Italian intellectuals in the matters of the New
    World, but the disjunction of historical events and linguistic tendencies is evident in their use of the word ‘<i>indiano.</i>’
    Tasso’s narration, in particular, is set in an era which could have not been further from the problem of India, and
    yet he celebrates Columbus, while referring to Muslim generals and knights as ‘<i>indiano</i>’. The word here is a
    synonym of infidel, but in the great praise paid to the courage of the ‘<i>fero indio’<a href="#riccio_edn18"
                                                                                             name="riccio_ednref18"
                                                                                             title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a></i>
    Adrasto it is free of any negative connotation. </p>
<p>Along the same lines, 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> century inventories of Venetian, Bolognese and Florentine
    collections confirm the historical-philological incoherence and the persistence of the idea of Amerasia in the
    Italian language. In the inventories of the Medici collection, for instance, the terms ‘<i>indiano</i>’, ‘<i>all’indiana’,
        ‘dell’India’ </i>were alternatively used to denote objects from America, Asia, Africa, thus encompassing many
    things exotic or foreign. Mixtec masks ‘<i>all’indiana</i>’, feather robes ‘<i>dell’India</i>’ were displayed
    together with Asian artifacts in Cosimo’s Guardaroba, the same one described by Vasari as a representation of the
    whole world. The same happens in Bolognese and Venetian collections, from the case of Ulisse Aldovrandi and his
    indiscriminate use of Indian and American terms, to the mention of ‘<i>una lucerta sive altro animale dell’America
        parte del mondo novamente ritrovata’</i><a href="#riccio_edn19"
                                                   name="riccio_ednref19"
                                                   title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a><i> </i>used in combination with ‘<i>indiano’ </i>or
    ‘<i>delle Indie’ </i>in the <i>Inventario </i>of Andrea Mantova Benavides (1695). (On the Florentine Codex owned by
    Ferdinando I de Medici, <a href="#raitt-florentinecodex">see the entry by Louisa Raitt</a>.) </p>
<p>To observe the occurrence of this phenomenon in visual arts, we can turn to Germany. Albrecht Altdorfer’s <i>Christ
    Crowned with Thorns</i> (1518), part of the <i>Saint Sebastian Altar, </i>is a parallel to Vasari’s textual fluidity
    in the realm of images. The background of the painting shows a secondary scene,<a href="#riccio_edn20"
                                                                                      name="riccio_ednref20"
                                                                                      title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a>
    characterized by the odd presence of a figure that can be easily identified as an Amerindian, from the feather
    headdress to the partial nudity and the club resting on his shoulder. The presence of this Indian, at first rather
    bizarre, could be explained by the fact that the scene is set in the Holy Land, a place east of Europe, and it
    represents episodes from the Passion of Christ. A character native to the most remote place on Earth, possibly pagan
    and infidel, could help us put a distance between our Christian Europe and the barbarous actions perpetrated against
    Christ. Altdorfer is also an interesting figure, since his case shares many similarities with Vasari’s. Both artists
    worked in an environment strongly fascinated with the New World: in Florence, the Medici were collecting American
    artefacts, just as was happening in Augsburg. The Florentine infatuation with the Americas developed during the
    course of the 16<sup>th</sup> century, taking the form of Ludovico Buti’s frescoes in the Uffizi, or that of the
    Thornton expedition in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. (On the Buti frescoes, <a
            href="#weitzman-armeria">see the essay Margo Weitzman</a>.)The Northern artists did not remain indifferent:
    the interest of artists such as Dürer and Burkmair (part of the same circle of Altdorfer) is evident in their
    drawings and illustrations, and the <i>Triumph of Maximilian I</i> (1518) could be considered the final phase of the
    evolution of this interest. The <a
            href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/431769" target="_blank">People of Calicut</a>, part of the procession
    in honor of the Emperor in the <i>Triumphs,</i> are the representation of this culture of exchanges, symbolizing at
    the same time the notions of extremities and fusion in a propagandistic and celebratory context. Expressly depicting
    Asian populations,<a href="#riccio_edn21"
                         name="riccio_ednref21"
                         title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a> they are characterized by a mixture of feather headdresses,
    Brazilian clubs and elephants, becoming the perfect embodiment of this combination of Asia and America, historical
    awareness and linguistic neglect. </p>
<p>In conclusion, ‘<i>indiano</i>’ and <i>‘India</i>’ were extremely ambiguous terms in the sixteenth and
    seventeenth centuries. They could acquire positive connotations or negative meanings, allude to distant and wealthy
    lands while hinting at familiar notions; they could refer to infidel savages and at the same time denote precious
    and luxurious product. The continuous use of these words in an undefined and malleable manner perfectly shows how,
    after more than five centuries, the mentality of Amerasia survives in our everyday language. </p>

          title=""><sup>[2]</sup> </a>From a linguistic point of view, Dante provides a helpful example. Purg.VII.74
        poses a series of problems of interpretation. Scholars usually identify <i>indico </i>with <i>indaco</i> (the
        blue pigment), but some propose that the words <i>indico</i> and <i>legno</i> should be read together, therefore
        indicating ebony (see Virgil, <i>Sola India nigrum fert hebanum</i>, Georg.II). Ebony is a type of wood typical
        of Ethiopia, as well as Asian regions such as Indochina and Sri Lanka. If we accept the second interpretation,
        this could exemplify the persistence of an India-Ethiopia overlap in the languages of 12th century Italy. A
        second example of this is the conflation of Ethiopia and India in the <i>Vocabolario degli Accademici della
            Crusca</i>, for instance ‘<i>nobilissimo</i>’ (N. ant. 1‘<i>Presto Giovanni nobilissimo signore Indiano </i>d’Etiopia’
        first edition, 1612, p. 557) and <i>‘dragone</i>’ (Tes. Br. Lib. 5. 4 ‘<i>Dragone è maggior generazione di tutti
            i serpenti, ed eziando è maggiore, che nessuna bestia al Mondo, e abitano in India nel Paese d’Etiopia, là
            ove sempre è grande state.</i>’ second edition, 1623, p. 301)</p>
