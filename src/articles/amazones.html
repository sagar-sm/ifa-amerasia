<h1>Amazones</h1>


<p>
    In Greek mythology, the Amazons were a tribe of women warriors who were
    located in the East, traditionally near the Scythians. Herodotus placed them
    on the banks of the Thermodon (Terme) River in southern Cappadocia, in what is
    today Turkey.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> John Mandeville placed
    “the land of Amazonia, in which there are no men, only women,” somewhere
    between Persia and India.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> In line with
    these ideas, Vopel places them just west of the Caspian Sea, also labeled by
    him the Scythian Gulf, <em>Sinus Scythiacus</em>, and somewhat to the north
    and east he places the Scythians.
</p>
<p>
    In his <em>Travels</em>, Marco Polo transferred the location of the Amazons to
    the Arabian Sea. As he described it, on two nearby islands, “the men do not
    live with their wives or with any other women; but all the women live on the
    other island, which is called Female Island. You must know that the men of
    Male Island go over to Female Island and stay there for three months…After
    this, they return to their own island…The sons who are born and nursed by
    their mothers in Female Island till they are fourteen years old, when they are
    sent to join their fathers in Male Island.”<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"

    According to Polo’s revamping of the myth, the Amazons lived on an island in
    Asia, and as a result, became associated with Polo’s description of the
    fabulous wealth of the Orient.
</p>
<p>
    In the wake of the Columbian voyages, these eastern places and peoples were
    searched for and found in the Americas. Columbus was the first to suggest that
    Amazons inhabited the Americas. Recounting his first voyage in his 1493 Letter
    to Santángel, Columbus built on Polo’s account and reported on the absence of
    men on the island of Matinino (Martinique). Here, “women do not follow
    feminine occupations but use cane bows and arrows like those of men and arm
    and protect themselves with plates of copper, of which they have much.”<a

    Columbus’ Amazonian resonance determined the Amerasian placement of these
    women for many years after his voyages; his description was enough to launch a
    decades-long search for Amazons in the Americas. To be clear, the Amazons were
    not an objective for Columbus per se; rather, their presence confirmed his
    expectations. They were clear proof that he was close to the Orient.

    The Castilian writer Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo’s chivalric romance
    <em>The Adventures of Esplandián (Las Sergas de Esplandián)</em> (1510)
    described Amazons on the “island” of California: “Know, that on the right hand
    of the Indies there is an island called California very close to the side of
    the Terrestrial Paradise; and it is peopled by black women, without any man
    among them, for they live in the manner of Amazons.<a

    (link to <a href="#archipelagus">Archipelagus entry</a>). In 1517, the conquistador Juan Díaz reported
    having heard of Amazons inhabiting the northern shore of the Yucatan.<a

    The governor of Cuba, Diego Velázquez, referred to the Amazons in his
    instructions to Hernán Cortés on the eve of his expedition to Mexico in 1519,
    and Cortés later noted hearing of their presence in his fourth letter of
    October 15, 1524 when he recounted the rumor of the explorer Cristobal de
    Olid, who had heard from the chiefs of Ciguatán that a short distance away,
    “there is an island inhabited only by women, without a single man, and that at
    certain times men go over from the mainland and have intercourse with them;
    the females born to those who conceive are kept, but the males are sent
    away.”<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a> Indigenous descriptions of the
    matriarchal organization and culture of certain Peruvian tribes, in particular
    the customs of the “Inca Virgins”, became identified with the Amazons.<a

    The Amazon river and the surrounding jungle acquired that name during
    Francisco de Orellana’s expedition into the area, described in the Dominican
    friar Gaspar de Carvajal’s 1542 account, where he recounts that at Aparia
    village, they began to hear of a community called by the locals
    <em>coniu puyara</em> (literally, large women), who lived further down the
    valley, and to whom surrounding communities offered tribute. Throughout his
    account, Carvajal calls them “Amazonas,” firmly and unambiguously identifying
    them with the legendary Asiatic warrior women.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9"

    The loquacious French traveler and cosmographer André Thevet felt compelled to
    address the issue of Amazons in South America at length in his
    <em>Singularitez de la France Antartique, autrement nommée Amérique</em> of
    1557. “Some might say that these are not real Amazons, but for myself I esteem
    them such, seeing that they live just as the ones in Asia did.” After offering
    a long account of Scythian Amazons based on ancient sources, he asks how these
    American Amazons got here, recounting that some say they came after the War of
    Troy, others say that they left Greece or Africa, chased by some cruel king.
    There are lots of stories about them, he admits, in the end leaving unresolved
    the question of the relation between the American and Asian Amazons.<a

    At the end of the sixteenth century, the English explorer Sir Walter Raleigh
    reported hearing of Amazons in his travel narrative <em>The Discovery of the
    Large, Rich, and Beautiful Empire of Guiana</em> (1596), when he had gone in search
    of Guiana, an empire rich in gold rumored to exist east of Peru.<a

    As with cannibals (link to <a href="#canibales">Canibales entry</a>), early modern Europeans
    transferred Asian visions of marvelous peoples to the Americas.
</p>
<p>
    Though it remained a disputed question, the association of Asian and American
    Amazons became so entrenched as to enter common usage: the identifier “Amazon”
    for the river and surrounding region is an Amerasian trace in modern
    geographical language. Even after America was recognized as a separate
    continent, the Amazonian associations continued to imbue American identity
    generally. The Amazon figure became virtually emblematic of America in many
    allegorical images of the continents, including Adriaen Collaert’s engraving
    of 1588-89 based on a design by Maerten de Vos, where the continent is
    represented by an Amazon-like woman wearing an elaborate feathered military
    helmet and wielding a battle axe and a bow and arrow. Thus, even as America
    was being imagined as a separate continent, she was formed out of
    Asian-derived Amazonian imagery.
