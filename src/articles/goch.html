<h1>Goch</h1>

<p>
    Under the Kingdom of Goch, Vopel says, “Or Lug and Mongug of the Royal city of
    Ciandu. The king Kublai Khan built this [city], which has a palace in marble
    that is immovable” (<em
>Seu Lug et Mongug/ Ciandu regalis. Hanc aedificauit mag/us Cham Cublai
    ha/bentem palatium/ marmore con/stans.</em
>) Here, Vopel has placed the kingdom of Gog and Magog in the northern part of
    his Amerasian continent. Gog and Magog, kings of unclean nations and often
    described as cannibals, appear in both the Hebrew Bible (Ezekiel 38, Genesis
    10), as well as in the Book of Revelation (Revelation 20), at times as
    peoples, lands, or tribes, and at times as individuals. According to medieval
    romances, Alexander the Great drove them beyond a mountain pass and blocked
    them from returning by constructing an impenetrable wall. On medieval maps,
    they are sometimes depicted behind a wall, though not on Vopel’s. Some
    historians, like the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, identified them with the
    Scythians, whereas early Christian writers identified them as Huns, Mongols,
    or the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.

    Vopel draws on Polo’s description of Gog and Magog as having lived in the
    lands of Prester John in the Chinese province of Tenduc (Vopel shows Gog and
    Magog to the north of Tenduc (Vopel’s TEUDUCH)). Polo says, “It is in this
    province [Tenduc] that Prester John had his chief residence when he was lord
    of the Tartars and of all these neighbouring provinces and kingdoms; and it is
    here that his descendants still live…. This is the place which we call in our
    language Gog and Magog; the natives call it Ung and Mungul.”<a

    Vopel does not follow Polo in placing Prester John there, opting to place him
    in Ethiopia (link to Prester John essay). However, he leaves a trace of Polo’s
    account of Christians in Tenduc by writing that “here are Christians, who are
    the best, who pay tribute to the great Khan” (<em
>Sunt hic Christiani qui/ primas tenent, tribu/ta pendentes magno Cham</em
>).
</p>
<p>
    Polo says that traveling north-north-east from Tenduc and the city of
    Chagan-nor (not indicated on Vopel’s map), “he comes to a city called
    Shang-tu, which was built by the Great Khan now reigning, whose name is
    Kubilai. In this city Kubilai Khan built a huge palace of marble.”<a

    It seems clear that Vopel has conflated the lands of Gog and Magog with the
    city of Shang-tu (Xanadu in Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s celebrated poem
    <em>Kubla Khan</em>).

    In this section of Vopel’s map, there are multiple Amerasian elements at play.
    Vopel is perhaps the only European source to suggest that the mythical kingdom
    of Prester John, normally located in India and Africa, had associations with
    the Americas; he does not say so directly, but by placing the province of
    Tenduc, populated by the best Christians, and the kingdom of Gog and Magog, on
    the Amerasian continent, he does so implicitly. In addition, Vopel has placed
    the kingdom of Gog and Magog and the lands of Shang-tu just to the west of
    Greater Spain (Hispania Maior), which, the inscription reads, “was subdued by
    Nuño de Guzman in the year 1530” (<em
>Haec a Numo Gusmano/ deuicta Anno 1530</em
>). That is, Vopel places Asian kingdoms aboiout 30 degrees longitude away
    from the lands colonized by the Spanish conquistador Nuno Guzman, who was
    famed for his cruelty against local indigenous tribes around what is today the
    Gulf Coast of North America. Here, Vopel also notes that in the lands around
    the Panuco River, “The Lord of the river from [Panucus] voluntarily subjected
    himself, along with his entire dominion, to his Imperial Majesty, with Hernán
    Cortés as a witness” (<em
>Dominus fluiij/ de panuco vltro/ secum vniuersa/ sua dirione [sic]
    Caesa/reae Maiestati subie/cit teste Ferdinando Cortesio</em
>). On the Vopel map, the drums of Spanish conquest are sounding not far from
    the gates of the legendary Asian kingdoms of Tenduc and Gog and Magog.
